== About this Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to use the features of the Jakarta EE Platform to build cloud-native applications,
such as microservices, "right sized" services, and server-based web applications.

== Prerequisites

Jakarta EE applications use the Java Platform, and are usually written in the Java programming language.
All the examples in this tutorial are written in Java.
If you're new to Java, spend some time getting up to speed on the language and platform;
a good place to start is https://dev.java/learn/[dev.java/learn].

Each topic in this tutorial provides some background information,
but in general,
we assume you have a basic understanding of the technologies each Jakarta EE feature works with.
For example, in the Jakarta Persistence chapter,
we assume you have a basic understanding of relational databases.
