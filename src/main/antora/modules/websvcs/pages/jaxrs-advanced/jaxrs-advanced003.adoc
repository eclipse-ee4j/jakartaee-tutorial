== Subresources and Runtime Resource Resolution

You can use a resource class to process only a part of the URI request.
A root resource can then implement subresources that can process the remainder of the URI path.

A resource class method that is annotated with `@Path` is either a subresource method or a subresource locator.

* A subresource method is used to handle requests on a subresource of the corresponding resource.

* A subresource locator is used to locate subresources of the corresponding resource.

=== Subresource Methods

A subresource method handles an HTTP request directly.
The method must be annotated with a request method designator, such as `@GET` or `@POST`, in addition to `@Path`.
The method is invoked for request URIs that match a URI template created by concatenating the URI template of the resource class with the URI template of the method.

The following code snippet shows how a subresource method can be used to extract the last name of an employee when the employee's email address is provided:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/employeeinfo")
public class EmployeeInfo {

    public employeeinfo() {}

    @GET
    @Path("/employees/{firstname}.{lastname}@{domain}.com")
    @Produces("text/xml")
    public String getEmployeeLastName(@PathParam("lastname") String lastName) {
       ...
    }
}
----

The `getEmployeeLastName` method returns `doe` for the following `GET` request:

[source,http]
----
GET /employeeinfo/employees/john.doe@example.com
----

=== Subresource Locators

A subresource locator returns an object that will handle an HTTP request.
The method must not be annotated with a request method designator.
You must declare a subresource locator within a subresource class, and only subresource locators are used for runtime resource resolution.

The following code snippet shows a subresource locator:

[source,java]
----
// Root resource class
@Path("/employeeinfo")
public class EmployeeInfo {

    // Subresource locator: obtains the subresource Employee
    // from the path /employeeinfo/employees/{empid}
    @Path("/employees/{empid}")
    public Employee getEmployee(@PathParam("empid") String id) {
        // Find the Employee based on the id path parameter
        Employee emp = ...;
        ...
        return emp;
    }
}

// Subresource class
public class Employee {

    // Subresource method: returns the employee's last name
    @GET
    @Path("/lastname")
    public String getEmployeeLastName() {
        ...
        return lastName;
    }
}
----

In this code snippet, the `getEmployee` method is the subresource locator that provides the `Employee` object, which services requests for `lastname`.

If your HTTP request is `GET /employeeinfo/employees/as209/`, the `getEmployee` method returns an `Employee` object whose id is `as209`. At runtime, Jakarta REST sends a `GET /employeeinfo/employees/as209/lastname` request to the `getEmployeeLastName` method.
The `getEmployeeLastName` method retrieves and returns the last name of the employee whose id is `as209`.
