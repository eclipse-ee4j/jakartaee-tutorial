== Conditional HTTP Requests

Jakarta REST provides support for conditional `GET` and `PUT` HTTP requests.
Conditional `GET` requests help save bandwidth by improving the efficiency of client processing.

A `GET` request can return a Not Modified (304) response if the representation has not changed since the previous request.
For example, a website can return 304 responses for all its static images that have not changed since the previous request.

A `PUT` request can return a Precondition Failed (412) response if the representation has been modified since the last request.
The conditional `PUT` can help avoid the lost update problem.

Conditional HTTP requests can be used with the `Last-Modified` and `ETag` headers.
The `Last-Modified` header can represent dates with granularity of one second.

@Path("/employee/{joiningdate}")
public class Employee {

    Date joiningdate;
    
    @GET
    @Produces("application/xml")    
    public Employee(@PathParam("joiningdate") Date joiningdate, 
                    @Context Request req, 
                    @Context UriInfo ui) {

        this.joiningdate = joiningdate;
        ...
        this.tag = computeEntityTag(ui.getRequestUri());
        if (req.getMethod().equals("GET")) {
            Response.ResponseBuilder rb = req.evaluatePreconditions(tag);
            if (rb != null) {
                throw new WebApplicationException(rb.build());
            }
        }
    }
}

In this code snippet, the constructor of the `Employee` class computes the entity tag from the request URI and calls the `request.evaluatePreconditions` method with that tag.
If a client request returns an `If-none-match` header with a value that has the same entity tag that was computed, `evaluate.Preconditions` returns a pre-filled-out response with a 304 status code and an entity tag set that may be built and returned.
