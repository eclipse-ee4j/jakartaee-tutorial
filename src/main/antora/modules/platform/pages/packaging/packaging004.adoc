== Packaging Resource Adapter Archives

A Resource Adapter Archive (RAR) file stores XML files, Java classes, and other objects for Jakarta EE Connector applications.
A resource adapter can be deployed on any Jakarta EE server, much like a Jakarta EE application.
A RAR file can be contained in an Enterprise Archive (EAR) file, or it can exist as a separate file.

The RAR file contains

* A JAR file with the implementation classes of the resource adapter

* An optional `META-INF/` directory that can store an `ra.xml` file and/or an application serverâ€“specific deployment descriptor used for configuration purposes

A RAR file can be deployed on the application server as a standalone component or as part of a larger application.
In both cases, the adapter is available to all applications using a lookup procedure.
