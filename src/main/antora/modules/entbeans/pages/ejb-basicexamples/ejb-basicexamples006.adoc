== Handling Exceptions

The exceptions thrown by enterprise beans fall into two categories: system and application.

A system exception indicates a problem with the services that support an application.
For example, a connection to an external resource cannot be obtained, or an injected resource cannot be found.
If it encounters a system-level problem, your enterprise bean should throw a `jakarta.ejb.EJBException`.
Because the `EJBException` is a subclass of `RuntimeException`, you do not have to specify it in the `throws` clause of the method declaration.
If a system exception is thrown, the Jakarta Enterprise Beans container might destroy the bean instance.
Therefore, a system exception cannot be handled by the bean's client program, but instead requires intervention by a system administrator.

An application exception signals an error in the business logic of an enterprise bean.
Application exceptions are typically exceptions that you've coded yourself, such as the `BookException` thrown by the business methods of the `CartBean` example.
When an enterprise bean throws an application exception, the container does not wrap it in another exception.
The client should be able to handle any application exception it receives.

If a system exception occurs within a transaction, the Enterprise Bean container rolls back the transaction.
However, if an application exception is thrown within a transaction, the container does not roll back the transaction.
