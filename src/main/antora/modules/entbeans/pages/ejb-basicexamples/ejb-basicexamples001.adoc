== Overview of the Jakarta Enterprise Beans Examples

In xref:ejb-gettingstarted/ejb-gettingstarted.adoc#_getting_started_with_enterprise_beans[Getting Started with Enterprise Beans], you built a stateless session bean named `ConverterBean`.
This chapter examines the source code of four more session beans:

* `CartBean`: a stateful session bean that is accessed by a remote client

* `CounterBean`: a singleton session bean

* `HelloServiceBean`: a stateless session bean that implements a web service

* `TimerSessionBean`: a stateless session bean that sets a timer
