== Jakarta EE Services

Jakarta EE provides a wide range of services, organized into three main categories.
Each category is implemented by one of three profiles.
The Core profile contains the foundational services.
The Web profile contains the Core profile plus services for writing web applications.
The Platform contains the Core and Web profiles, plus additional services for mail, batch processing,
and messaging, and more.
