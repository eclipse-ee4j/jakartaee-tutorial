== Jakarta EE 10 Platform Highlights

Jakarta EE 10 is the first feature release of the platform since it moved to the Eclipse Foundation several years ago.

* Closing standardization gaps
** OpenID Connect support in Jakarta Security
** UUID as entity keys, more SQL support in Jakarta Persistence queries
** Multipart/form-data support in Jakarta REST
** `@ClientWindowScoped` and Facelet pure Java views in Jakarta Faces
** New Core Profile that includes Jakarta CDI Light to enable next generation cloud native runtimes; used by MicroProfile
** Jakarta Concurrency has moved to the Web Profile
* Deprecation/removal
