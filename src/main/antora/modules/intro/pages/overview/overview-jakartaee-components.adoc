=== Jakarta EE Components

Jakarta EE applications are made up of components. A *Jakarta EE component* is a self-contained functional unit that
makes use of one or more container services.
That usage could be as simple as injecting a single dependency
or responding to REST requests, or as complicated as
injecting multiple dependencies, querying a database, firing and event, and participating in distributed transactions.

Jakarta EE supports the following components:

* *Web components{empty}footnote:[Not to be confused with the web browser standard, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components[Web Components], or user interface widgets in general, which are often called UI components.]* interact with web standards (HTTPS, HTML, WebSocket, and so on) using Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Faces, Jakarta WebSocket, and related technologies.
* Business components implement logic necessary to support the business domain using either *Enterprise bean components (enterprise beans)*{empty}footnote:[Enterprise Beans previously supported persistence via Entity Beans, but that has been deprecated in favor of Jakarta Persistence] or CDI managed beans.
** For new applications, business components should be implemented using CDI managed beans,
unless you need Enterprise bean-specific features such as transactions, role-based security,
messaging driven beans, or remote execution.
The two technologies play well together.

All of these components run on the *server{empty}footnote:[Application Clients are
technically supported as well, although they are rarely used.]*,
and are ordinary Java classes written with Jakarta EE annotations (or optionally,
external configuration files called deployment descriptors).
