== Using Named Entity Graphs

Named entity graphs are created using annotations applied to entity classes or the `named-entity-graph` element and its sub-elements in the application's deployment descriptor.
The persistence provider will scan for all named entity graphs, defined in both annotations and in XML, within an application.
A named entity graph set using an annotation may be overridden using `named-entity-graph`.

=== Applying Named Entity Graph Annotations to Entity Classes

The `jakarta.persistence.NamedEntityGraph` annotation defines a single named entity graph and is applied at the class level.
Multiple `@NamedEntityGraph` annotations may be defined for a class by adding them within a `jakarta.persistence.NamedEntityGraphs` class-level annotation.

The `@NamedEntityGraph` annotation must be applied on the root of the graph of entities.
That is, if the `EntityManager.find` or query operation has as its root entity the `EmailMessage` class, the named entity graph used in the operation must be defined in the `EmailMessage` class:

[source,java]
----
@NamedEntityGraph
@Entity
public class EmailMessage {
    @Id
    String messageId;
    String subject;
    String body;
    String sender;
}
----

In this example, the `EmailMessage` class has a `@NamedEntityGraph` annotation to define a named entity graph that defaults to the name of the class, `EmailMessage`.
No fields are included in the `@NamedEntityGraph` annotation as attribute nodes, and the fields are not annotated with metadata to set the fetch type, so the only field that will be eagerly fetched in either a load graph or fetch graph is `messageId`.

The attributes of a named entity graph are the fields of the entity that should be included in the entity graph.
Add the fields to the entity graph by specifying them in the `attributeNodes` element of `@NamedEntityGraph` with a `jakarta.persistence.NamedAttributeNode` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@NamedEntityGraph(name="emailEntityGraph", attributeNodes={
    @NamedAttributeNode("subject"),
    @NamedAttributeNode("sender")
})
@Entity
public class EmailMessage { ... }
----

In this example, the name of the named entity graph is `emailEntityGraph` and includes the `subject` and `sender` fields.

Multiple `@NamedEntityGraph` definitions may be applied to a class by grouping them within a `@NamedEntityGraphs` annotation.

In the following example, two entity graphs are defined on the `EmailMessage` class.
One is for a preview pane, which fetches only the sender, subject, and body of the message.
The other is for a full view of the message, including any message attachments:

[source,java]
----
@NamedEntityGraphs({
    @NamedEntityGraph(name="previewEmailEntityGraph", attributeNodes={
        @NamedAttributeNode("subject"),
        @NamedAttributeNode("sender"),
        @NamedAttributeNode("body")
    }),
    @NamedEntityGraph(name="fullEmailEntityGraph", attributeNodes={
        @NamedAttributeNode("sender"),
        @NamedAttributeNode("subject"),
        @NamedAttributeNode("body"),
        @NamedAttributeNode("attachments")
    })
})
@Entity
public class EmailMessage { ... }
----

=== Obtaining EntityGraph Instances from Named Entity Graphs

Use the `EntityManager.getEntityGraph` method, passing in the named entity graph name, to obtain `EntityGraph` instances for a named entity graph:

[source,java]
----
EntityGraph<EmailMessage> eg = em.getEntityGraph("emailEntityGraph");
----
