== Entity Graph Basics

You can create entity graphs statically by using annotations or a deployment descriptor, or dynamically by using standard interfaces.

You can use an entity graph with the `EntityManager.find` method or as part of a JPQL or Criteria API query by specifying the entity graph as a hint to the operation or query.

Entity graphs have attributes that correspond to the fields that will be eagerly fetched during a `find` or query operation.
The primary key and version fields of the entity class are always fetched and do not need to be explicitly added to an entity graph.

=== The Default Entity Graph

By default, all fields in an entity are fetched lazily unless the `fetch` attribute of the entity metadata is set to `jakarta.persistence.FetchType.EAGER`.
The default entity graph consists of all the fields of an entity whose fields are set to be eagerly fetched.

For example, the following `EmailMessage` entity specifies that some fields will be fetched eagerly:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class EmailMessage implements Serializable {
    @Id
    String messageId;
    @Basic(fetch=EAGER)
    String subject;
    String body;
    @Basic(fetch=EAGER)
    String sender;
    @OneToMany(mappedBy="message", fetch=LAZY)
    Set<EmailAttachment> attachments;
    ...
}
----

The default entity graph for this entity would contain the `messageId`, `subject`, and `sender` fields, but not the `body` or `attachments` fields.

=== Using Entity Graphs in Persistence Operations

Entity graphs are used by creating an instance of the `jakarta.persistence.EntityGraph` interface by calling either `EntityManager.getEntityGraph` for named entity graphs or `EntityManager.createEntityGraph` for creating dynamic entity graphs.

A named entity graph is an entity graph specified by the `@NamedEntityGraph` annotation applied to entity classes, or the `named-entity-graph` element in the application's deployment descriptors.
Named entity graphs defined within the deployment descriptor override any annotation-based entity graphs with the same name.

The created entity graph can be either a fetch graph or a load graph.

==== Fetch Graphs

To specify a fetch graph, set the `jakarta.persistence.fetchgraph` property when you execute an `EntityManager.find` or query operation.
A fetch graph consists of only the fields explicitly specified in the `EntityGraph` instance, and ignores the default entity graph settings.

In the following example, the default entity graph is ignored, and only the `body` field is included in the dynamically created fetch graph:

[source,java]
----
EntityGraph<EmailMessage> eg = em.createEntityGraph(EmailMessage.class);
eg.addAttributeNodes("body");
...
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("jakarta.persistence.fetchgraph", eg);
EmailMessage message = em.find(EmailMessage.class, id, props);
----

==== Load Graphs

To specify a load graph, set the `jakarta.persistence.loadgraph` property when you execute an `EntityManager.find` or query operation.
A load graph consists of the fields explicitly specified in the `EntityGraph` instance plus any fields in the default entity graph.

In the following example, the dynamically created load graph contains all the fields in the default entity graph plus the `body` field:

[source,java]
----
EntityGraph<EmailMessage> eg = em.createEntityGraph(EmailMessage.class);
eg.addAttributeNodes("body");
...
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("jakarta.persistence.loadgraph", eg);
EmailMessage message = em.find(EmailMessage.class, id, props);
----
