To declare the usage of a specific authentication mechanism, Jakarta EE provides `[XYZ]MechanismDefinition` annotations. Such an annotation is picked up by the security system, and in response to it a CDI bean that implements the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/authentication/mechanism/http/httpauthenticationmechanism[HttpAuthenticationMechanism,role=external,window=_blank] is enabled for it.

The annotation can be put on any bean, but in a REST application it fits particularly well on the `Application` subclass because it also declares the path for REST resources.
