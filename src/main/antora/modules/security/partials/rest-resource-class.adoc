Let's start with defining a simple REST resource class for a `/rest/resource` endpoint:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/resource")
@RequestScoped
public class Resource {

    @Inject
    private SecurityContext securityContext;

    @GET
    @Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String getCallerAndRole() {
        return
            securityContext.getCallerPrincipal().getName() + " : " +
            securityContext.isCallerInRole("user");
    }

}
----

This resource uses the injected Jakarta EE https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/securitycontext[SecurityContext,role=external,window=_blank] to obtain access to the current authenticated caller, which is represented by a `Principal` instance.

If this resource were available to unauthenticated callers, `getCallerPrincipal()` would return `null` for unauthenticated requests, so we'd have to check for `null`. Our example, however, requires authentication for this resource, so we can skip that check.

NOTE: There is a Jakarta REST-specific type that is also named https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.1/apidocs/jakarta.ws.rs/jakarta/ws/rs/core/securitycontext[SecurityContext,role=external,window=_blank] and has similar methods as the ones we used here. From the Jakarta EE perspective, that is a discouraged type and the Jakarta Security version is to be preferred.
