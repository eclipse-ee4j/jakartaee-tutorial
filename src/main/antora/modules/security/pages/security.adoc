= Jakarta Security

Jakarta Security is the overarching security API in Jakarta EE. Overarching here means that it strives to address the security needs of all other APIs in Jakarta EE in a holistic way.

Due to historical and political reasons, a number of security features are still distributed among several other APIs in Jakarta EE. Sometimes they overlap, and sometimes such features are only accessible from these other APIs. In this chapter, we'll focus primarily on explaining Jakarta Security, but we'll mention when other APIs are needed to accomplish a certain task.

== Overview

Before we look at some practical examples, let's quickly go through some basics.

Some of the guiding principles in Jakarta Security are:

. It should work directly out of the box, without requiring vendor-specific configuration.
. It leverages Jakarta CDI as much as possible. Most artifacts are CDI beans, and many features are done via CDI interceptors.
. The difference between framework-provided artifacts and custom (user provided) artifacts is minimal or non-existent.
. It fully integrates with security features from other Jakarta EE APIs and proprietary (vendor-specific) artifacts.

Jakarta Security defines several distinct artifacts that play an important role in the security process:

. https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/jakarta-security-spec-3.0.html#authentication-mechanism[Authentication Mechanism,role=external,window=_blank]
. https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/jakarta-security-spec-3.0.html#identity-store[Identity Store,role=external,window=_blank]
. Permission Store

The first two of these are used in the authentication process:

An _authentication mechanism_ is somewhat like a controller in the well-known https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller[MVC,role=external,window=_blank] pattern; it is the entity that interacts with the caller (typically a human), via some kind of view to collect credentials, and with the model (business logic) to validate `these` credentials. An authentication mechanism knows about the environment this caller uses to communicate with the server. An authentication mechanism for HTTP knows about URLs to redirect or forward to, or about response headers to send to the client. It also knows about the data coming back, such as cookies, request headers, and post data. Examples of authentication mechanisms are Form authentication and Basic authentication.

An _identity store_ is more like the model in the MVC pattern. This entity strictly performs a business / data operation where credentials go in, and an identity comes out. The identity contains logic to validate said credentials, and embeds or contacts a database. This "database" contains usernames, along with their credentials and (typically) roles. An identity store therefore knows nothing about the environment that this caller uses to communicate with the server; for example, it doesn't know about HTTP or headers and more.
Some examples of identity stores are services that contact SQL or NoSQL databases, LDAP servers, files on the file-system, and more.

<<_mechanism_store_in_mvc>> shows the _authentication mechanism_ and _identity store_ in an MVC-like structure.

[[_mechanism_store_in_mvc]]
.Mechanism Store in MVC
image::authentication-mvc.svg["Diagram illustrating the role of the authentication mechanism and identity store in an MVC like structure"]

The third one is used for the authorization process:

A _permission store_ is another kind of model that stores permissions, typically either globally, or per role (role-based permissions). This entity then performs a business / data operation where a query and an identity go in, and a yes/no answer goes out. For instance, a query such as "can access /foo/bar?" along with the identity for user "John" with roles "bar" and "kaz" would return "yes" if that identity is authorized to access "/foo/bar", and "no" if not authorized.
Examples of permission stores are the Jakarta Authorization usage of the Policy class, or the internal data structure where a Servlet Container such as Tomcat or Jetty stores the security constraints an application defined.

== Provided authentication mechanisms and identity stores

Jakarta Security provides a number of built-in authentication mechanisms and identity stores. We'll enumerate them here first, and will look at them in more detail below.

Authentication mechanisms:

. https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/jakarta-security-spec-3.0.html#basic-annotation[Basic,role=external,window=_blank]
. https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/jakarta-security-spec-3.0.html#form-annotation[Form,role=external,window=_blank]
. https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/jakarta-security-spec-3.0.html#custom-form-annotation[Custom Form,role=external,window=_blank]
. https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/jakarta-security-spec-3.0.html#openid-connect-annotation[Open ID Connect (OIDC),role=external,window=_blank]

Identity stores:

. https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/jakarta-security-spec-3.0.html#database-annotation[Database,role=external,window=_blank]
. https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/jakarta-security-spec-3.0.html#ldap-annotation[LDAP,role=external,window=_blank]

== Custom authentication mechanisms and identity stores

When the provided authentication mechanisms and identity stores aren't sufficient, we can easily define custom ones. Both provided and custom ones use https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/identitystore/identitystore[the same interfaces,role=external,window=_blank], and the system doesn't distinguish between them.

== Authentication mechanisms and identity stores from other APIs

The https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.0.html[Servlet specification,role=external,window=_blank] defines the exact same https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.0.html#form-based-authentication[Form,role=external,window=_blank] and https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-6.0.html#http-basic-authentication[Basic,role=external,window=_blank] authentication mechanisms. Authenticating with them will have the same result as authenticating with a Jakarta Security authentication mechanism. (Role checks will work the same independent on which API was used to authenticate.)

A Servlet authentication mechanism, however, will not necessarily consult a Jakarta Security identity store. This is server dependent. The identity store that is called is server dependent as well. Calling this server-dependent identity store is possible from Jakarta Security, but as an advanced feature.

Likewise, programmatic role checks can be done from various APIs, including Jakarta Security, Jakarta REST, and Jakarta Servlet. These all return the same outcome, independent of whether authentication took place with a Jakarta Security Authentication Mechanism or a Servlet Authentication Mechanism. Within a Jakarta EE environment the usage of Jakarta Security for this is encouraged, and the usage of those other APIs is discouraged.

NOTE: Programmatic role checks in Jakarta REST, Jakarta Servlet and various other APIs are not being deprecated for the time being, as those APIs are also used stand-alone (outside Jakarta EE). Future versions of those APIs may contain warnings about their usage within Jakarta EE.

== Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication

In the following example, we'll be securing a REST endpoint using Basic authentication.

You'll learn how to:

. Define (and implicitly set) a custom identity store

}

[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6.414 s - in jakartaee.examples.focused.security.restbasicauthcustomstore.RestBasicAuthCustomStoreIT
----

Let's take a quick look at the actual test:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class RestBasicAuthCustomStoreIT extends ITBase {

    /**
     * Stores the base URL.
     */
    @ArquillianResource
    private URL baseUrl;

    /**
     * Test the call to a protected REST service
     *
     * @throws Exception when a serious error occurs.
     */
    @RunAsClient
    @Test
    public void testRestCall() throws Exception {
        DefaultCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = new DefaultCredentialsProvider();
        credentialsProvider.addCredentials("john", "secret1");

        webClient.setCredentialsProvider(credentialsProvider);

        TextPage page = webClient.getPage(baseUrl + "/rest/resource");
        String content = page.getContent();

        System.out.println(content);
    }
}
----

include::partial$inspect-app.adoc[]

The `DefaultCredentialsProvider` used here makes sure that the headers for Basic authentication are added to the request. The Basic authentication mechanism that we defined for our applications reads those headers, extracts the username and password from them, and consults our identity store with them.




== Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication and a database identity store

In the following example, we'll secure a REST endpoint using Basic authentication and the database identity store that is provided by Jakarta Security.

You'll learn how to:

include::partial$list-item-learn-security-constraints.adoc[]
include::partial$list-item-learn-basic-authentication.adoc[]
. Use the provided https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/identitystore/databaseidentitystoredefinition[DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition,role=external,window=_blank]
. Populate and configure the identity store
include::partial$list-item-learn-security-context.adoc[]

=== Write the application

include::partial$rest-resource-class.adoc[]

==== Declare the authentication mechanism and identity store

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
@BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
    realmName = "basicAuth"
)
@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition(
    callerQuery = "select password from basic_auth_user where username = ?",
    groupsQuery = "select name from basic_auth_group where username = ?",
    hashAlgorithmParameters = {
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Iterations=3072",
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Algorithm=PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512",
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.SaltSizeBytes=64"
    }
)
@DeclareRoles("user")
@ApplicationPath("/rest")
public class ApplicationConfig extends Application {

----

include::partial$declare-authentication-mechanism.adoc[]

Likewise, to declare the usage of a specific identity store, Jakarta EE provides `[XYZ]StoreDefinition` annotations.

The annotations can be put on any bean, but in a REST application it fits particularly well on the `Application` subclass that also declares the path for REST resources.

You can use the provided `DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition` with any authentication mechanism that validates username/password credentials. It requires at least two SQL queries:

. A query that returns a password for the username part of credentials. The returned password is compared with the password part of those credentials. If they match (of more typically, their hashes match) the credential is considered valid.
. A query that returns a number of roles given that same username part of the credentials

Although not required, it's a good practice to provide some parameters for the hash algorithm. Passwords should never be stored in plain-text in a database.

==== Populating the identity store

In order to use the identity store, we need to put some data in a database. The following code shows one way how to do that:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
@BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
    realmName = "basicAuth"
)
@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition(
    callerQuery = "select password from basic_auth_user where username = ?",
    groupsQuery = "select name from basic_auth_group where username = ?",
    hashAlgorithmParameters = {
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Iterations=3072",
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Algorithm=PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512",
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.SaltSizeBytes=64"
    }
)
@DeclareRoles("user")
@ApplicationPath("/rest")
public class ApplicationConfig extends Application {

    /**
     * Id of the one and only user we populate in out DB.
     */
    private static final BigInteger USER_ID = ONE;

    /**
     * Id of the one and only group we populate in out DB.
     */
    private static final BigInteger GROUP_ID = ONE;

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    @Inject
    private Pbkdf2PasswordHash passwordHash;

    @Transactional
    public void onStart(@Observes @Initialized(ApplicationScoped.class) Object applicationContext) {
        passwordHash.initialize(Map.of(
            "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Iterations", "3072",
            "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Algorithm", "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512",
            "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.SaltSizeBytes", "64"));

        if (entityManager.find(User.class, USER_ID) == null) {
            var user = new User();
            user.id  = USER_ID;
            user.username = "john";
            user.password = passwordHash.generate("secret1".toCharArray());
            entityManager.persist(user);
        }

        if (entityManager.find(Group.class, GROUP_ID) == null) {
            var group = new Group();
            group.id = GROUP_ID;
            group.name = "user";
            group.username = "john";
            entityManager.persist(group);
        }
    }

}

@Entity
@Table(name = "basic_auth_user")
class User {
    @Id
    BigInteger id;

    @Column(name = "password")
    String password;

    @Column(name = "username", unique = true)
    String username;
}

@Entity
@Table(name = "basic_auth_group")
class Group {
    @Column(name = "id")
    @Id
    BigInteger id;

    @Column(name = "name")
    String name;

    @Column(name = "username")
    String username;
}
----

The code above uses Jakarta Persistence, which generates SQL from Java types. Jakarta Persistence is discussed in detail in its own chapter. Since we haven't specified a datasource, the `@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition` annotation will use the default datasource defined in Jakarta EE, so you don't have to explicitly install and configure an external database such as Postgres or MySQL. However, if necessary, you can configure a different one using the `dataSourceLookup` attribute.

==== Test the application

:app-name: restBasicAuthDBStore

[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 8.307 s - in jakartaee.examples.focused.security.restbasicauthdbstore.RestBasicAuthDBStoreIT
----

The test itself is basically the same as that for the <<Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication>> example.





== Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication and multiple identity stores

In the following example, we'll be securing a REST endpoint using Basic authentication and two identity stores: the database identity store that is provided by Jakarta Security and a custom identity store.

You'll learn how to:

include::partial$list-item-learn-security-constraints.adoc[]
include::partial$list-item-learn-basic-authentication.adoc[]
. Use the provided https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/identitystore/databaseidentitystoredefinition[DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition,role=external,window=_blank]
. Create a custom https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/identitystore/package-summary.html[identity store,role=external,window=_blank]
include::partial$list-item-learn-security-context.adoc[]

=== Write the application

include::partial$rest-resource-class.adoc[]

==== Declare the authentication mechanism and identity store

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
@BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
    realmName = "basicAuth"
)
@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition(
    callerQuery = "select password from basic_auth_user where username = ?",
    groupsQuery = "select name from basic_auth_group where username = ?",
    hashAlgorithmParameters = {
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Iterations=3072",
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Algorithm=PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512",
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.SaltSizeBytes=64"
    }
)
@DeclareRoles("user")
@ApplicationPath("/rest")
public class ApplicationConfig extends Application {

----

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomIdentityStore implements IdentityStore {

    public CredentialValidationResult validate(UsernamePasswordCredential usernamePasswordCredential) {
        if (usernamePasswordCredential.compareTo("pete", "secret2")) {
            return new CredentialValidationResult("pete", Set.of("user", "caller"));
        }

        return INVALID_RESULT;
    }

}
----

In this example we have two enabled CDI beans implementing the `IdentityStore` interface. One of them will be implicitly enabled via the `@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition` annotation, while the other one is defined explicitly via the `CustomIdentityStore` class. As with a single identity store, it doesn't matter how or where the CDI beans are defined, only that multiple enabled ones exist.

When multiple identity stores are present, the security system will try them in order of their priority. We didn't set a priority here, so the order will be undefined. If the default validation algorithm is used, a successful validation wins over a failed validation. For example, let's say we have multiple identity stores that know about the user "pete". If "pete" fails validation in one store, but passes validation in another store, the end result is still that validation passed.

In the two stores above, however only one store knows about "pete" and that's the `CustomIdentityStore`. The store created from `@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition` doesn't know about "pete" at all, and will simply not validate it.


==== Populating the identity store

In order to use the identity store, we need to put some data in a database. This is done in the same as in <<Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication and a database identity store>>.

==== Test the application

:app-name: restBasicAuthDBStoreAndCustomStore
include::partial$test-github.adoc[]

[source]
----
john : true
pete : true
[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 9.239 s - in jakartaee.examples.focused.security.restbasicauthdbstoreandcustomstore.RestBasicAuthDBStoreAndCustomStoreIT
----

Let's take a quick look at the actual test again:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class RestBasicAuthDBStoreAndCustomStoreIT extends ITBase {

    @ArquillianResource
    private URL baseUrl;

    /**
     * Test the call to a protected REST service
     *
     * <p>
     * This will use the "john" credentials, which should be validated by the DB store
     *
     * @throws Exception when a serious error occurs.
     */
    @RunAsClient
    @Test
    public void testRestCall1() throws Exception {
        DefaultCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = new DefaultCredentialsProvider();
        credentialsProvider.addCredentials("john", "secret1");

        webClient.setCredentialsProvider(credentialsProvider);

        TextPage page = webClient.getPage(baseUrl + "/rest/resource");
        String content = page.getContent();

        System.out.println(content);
    }

    /**
     * Test the call to a protected REST service
     *
     * <p>
     * This will use the "pete" credentials, which should be validated by the custom store
     *
     * @throws Exception when a serious error occurs.
     */
    @RunAsClient
    @Test
    public void testRestCall2() throws Exception {
        DefaultCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = new DefaultCredentialsProvider();
        credentialsProvider.addCredentials("pete", "secret2");

        webClient.setCredentialsProvider(credentialsProvider);

        TextPage page = webClient.getPage(baseUrl + "/rest/resource");
        String content = page.getContent();

        System.out.println(content);
    }
}
----

include::partial$inspect-app.adoc[]

We have two tests here: in one test we try to authenticate as "john", in the other test as "pete". As we've seen, each identity store only validates one of them. The fact that both tests pass demonstrates that each store will validate the right user, and that not recognizing a username by any of them will not fail the overall validation.





== Securing an endpoint with Form authentication

In the following example, we'll secure a REST endpoint using Form authentication.

You'll learn how to:

include::partial$list-item-learn-security-constraints.adoc[]
. Use the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/authentication/mechanism/http/formauthenticationmechanismdefinition[Form authentication mechanism,role=external,window=_blank]
. How to define (and implicitly set) a custom https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/identitystore/package-summary.html[identity store,role=external,window=_blank]
include::partial$list-item-learn-security-context.adoc[]

=== Write the application

include::partial$rest-resource-class.adoc[]

==== Declare the security constraints

include::partial$declare-security-constraints.adoc[]

==== Declare the authentication mechanism

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
@FormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
    loginToContinue = @LoginToContinue(
        loginPage="/login.html",
        errorPage="/login-error.html"
    )
)
@DeclareRoles({ "user", "caller" })
@ApplicationPath("/rest")
public class ApplicationConfig extends Application {

}
----

include::partial$declare-authentication-mechanism.adoc[]

Contrary to the Basic HTTP authentication mechanism, the Form authentication mechanism allows us to customize the login dialog (the process between the caller and the authentication mechanism) and to keep track of the authenticated session on the server (using a cookie). This also allows us to logout, something that for unknown reasons has never been specified for Basic HTTP authentication.

To use this authentication method, we need to designate two paths to resources that are relative to our application. One path is for the login page, which the user will be directed to when attempting to access a protected resource. The other path is for when login fails, such as when the user enters incorrect login credentials. If the paths are the same, a request parameter can be used to distinguish between them. Paths can point to anything our server can respond to; a static HTML file, a REST resource, or anything else. For simplicity, we'll use two static HTML files here:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head><title>Login to continue</title></head>
    <body>
        <h1>Login to continue</h1>
        <form method="post" action="j_security_check">
            <div>
                <label>Username: <input type="text" name="j_username"></label>
            </div>
            <div>
                <label>Password: <input type="password" name="j_password"></label>
            </div>
            <div>
                <input type="submit" value="Submit">
            </div>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
----

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head><title>Login failed!</title></head>
    <body>
        <h1>Login failed!</h1>
        <div>
            <a href="login.html">Try again</a>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
----

==== Define the identity store

Finally, let's define a basic identity store that the security system can use to validate provided credentials for Form authentication:

[source,java]
-----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomIdentityStore implements IdentityStore {

    public CredentialValidationResult validate(UsernamePasswordCredential usernamePasswordCredential) {
        if (usernamePasswordCredential.compareTo("john", "secret1")) {
            return new CredentialValidationResult("john", Set.of("user", "caller"));
        }

        return INVALID_RESULT;
    }

}
-----

This identity store only validates the single identity (user) "john", with password "secret1" and roles "user" and "caller". Defining this kind of identity store is often the simplest way to get started. Note that Jakarta Security doesn't define a simple identity store out of the box, because there are questions about whether that would promote security best practices.

include::partial$identity-store-installed.adoc[]

==== Test the application

Let's take a quick look at the actual test:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class RestFormAuthCustomStoreIT extends ITBase {

    @ArquillianResource
    private URL baseUrl;

    /**
     * Test the call to a protected REST service
     *
     * @throws Exception when a serious error occurs.
     */
    @RunAsClient
    @Test
    public void testRestCall() throws Exception {
        HtmlPage loginPage = webClient.getPage(baseUrl + "/rest/resource");
        System.out.println(loginPage.asXml());

        HtmlForm form = loginPage.getForms()
                                 .get(0);

        form.getInputByName("j_username")
            .setValueAttribute("john");

        form.getInputByName("j_password")
            .setValueAttribute("secret1");

        TextPage page = form.getInputByValue("Submit")
                   .click();

        System.out.println(page.getContent());
    }
}
----

include::partial$inspect-app.adoc[]

The test first sends a request here to the protected resource, and the server responds with the HTML form we defined above. Using the `HtmlUnit` API, it's easy to navigate the HTML DOM, fill out the username and password in the form, and programmatically click the Submit button. The form posts back to a special "j_security_check" URL, where the authentication mechanism receives the request and retrieves the username and password from the POST data, much like the Basic authentication mechanism retrieves them from the HTTP headers.




== Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication and a custom algorithm for handling multiple identity stores

In the following example, we'll be securing a REST endpoint using Basic authentication and two identity stores: the database identity store that is provided by Jakarta Security and a custom identity store. Instead of relying on the default algorithm provided by Jakarta Security to handle multiple identity stores we'll be using a custom algoritm.

=== Write the application

We'll use a slightly modified resource and security constraints compared to the ones we used for the <<Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication>> example.

The REST resource is now as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/resource")
@RequestScoped
public class Resource {

    @Inject
    private SecurityContext securityContext;

    @GET
    @Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String getCallerAndRole() {
        return
            securityContext.getCallerPrincipal().getName() + " : " +
            securityContext.isCallerInRole("user") + "," +
            securityContext.isCallerInRole("caller1") + "," +
            securityContext.isCallerInRole("caller2");
    }

}
----

As can be seen, the difference is quite small; we're now printing out the results of two extra role checks.


`web.xml` on its turn looks as follows now:

[source,xml]
----
<web-app xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/web-app_6_0.xsd"
         version="6.0">

    <security-constraint>
        <web-resource-collection>
            <web-resource-name>protected</web-resource-name>
            <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
            <role-name>user</role-name>
            <role-name>caller2</role-name>
        </auth-constraint>
    </security-constraint>
    <security-role>
        <role-name>caller1</role-name>
    </security-role>

</web-app>
----

Compared to the example in <<Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication>> we have now added an extra role to the `<auth-constraint>` section. The semantics of that are that a caller needs to have both of these roles in order to be authorised to access the resource under `/rest/*`.

Although it's customary to explicitly declare all roles in the application using `<security-role>`, it's technically not needed. As long as the role name appears in some XML fragment or annotation attribute the Jakarta EE requirement to declare all roles upfront is satisfied. As we can see in the fragment above, the role names "user" and "caller2" already appear in the `<auth-constraint>` section, so they don't *have* to be repeated.

NOTE: The reason it's deemed good practice to list all roles in the `<security-role>` element in web.xml (or alternatively in an `@DeclareRoles` annotation) even when not really needed is to have a single place where all roles are listed, instead of them being scattered throughout the application.


==== Declare the authentication mechanism and identity store

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
@BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
    realmName = "basicAuth"
)
@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition(
    callerQuery = "select password from basic_auth_user where username = ?",
    groupsQuery = "select name from basic_auth_group where username = ?",
    hashAlgorithmParameters = {
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Iterations=3072",
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.Algorithm=PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512",
        "Pbkdf2PasswordHash.SaltSizeBytes=64"
    }
)
@DeclareRoles("user")
@ApplicationPath("/rest")
public class ApplicationConfig extends Application {

----

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomIdentityStore implements IdentityStore {

    public CredentialValidationResult validate(UsernamePasswordCredential usernamePasswordCredential) {
        if (usernamePasswordCredential.compareTo("john", "secret1")) {
            return new CredentialValidationResult("john", Set.of("caller1", "caller2"));
        }

        return INVALID_RESULT;
    }

}
----

In this example we have two enabled CDI beans implementing the `IdentityStore` interface. One of them will be implicitly enabled via the `@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition` annotation, while the other one is defined explicitly via the `CustomIdentityStore` class. As with a single identity store, it doesn't matter how or where the CDI beans are defined, only that multiple enabled ones exist.

When multiple identity stores are present, an identity store handler (of type `IdentityStoreHandler`) is consulted. Jakara Security provides a default one as explained in <<Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication and multiple identity stores>>. This default handler can be overridden however to provide custom semantics. We'll use a custom handler to enforce a caller authenticates with both identity stores, and we'll combine the roles returned by both in the final result.

==== Populating the identity store

In order to use the identity store, we need to put some data in a database. This is done in the same as in <<Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication and a Database identity store>>.

NOTE: In the custom identity store defined above and in the database identity store here we both use name "john' and password "secret1".

==== Writing the identity store handler

We'll now write the identity store handler:

[source,java]
----
@Alternative <1>
@Priority(APPLICATION) <2>
@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomIdentityStoreHandler implements IdentityStoreHandler {

    @Inject
    Instance<IdentityStore> identityStores; <3>

    @Override
    public CredentialValidationResult validate(Credential credential) {
        CredentialValidationResult result = null;
        Set<String> groups = new HashSet<>();

        for (IdentityStore identityStore : identityStores) {
            result = identityStore.validate(credential);
            if (result.getStatus() == NOT_VALIDATED) {
                // Identity store probably doesn't handle our credential type
                continue;
            }

            if (result.getStatus() == INVALID) {
                // Identity store handled our credential type and determined its
                // invalid. End the loop.
                return INVALID_RESULT;
            }

            groups.addAll(result.getCallerGroups());
        }

        return new CredentialValidationResult(
            result.getCallerPrincipal(), groups);
    }
}
----
<1> Since we're overriding an existing CDI bean (the default `IdentityStoreHandler` provided by Jakarta Security), we have to annotate our custom `IdentityStoreHandler` with `@Alternative`.
<2> To make `@Alternative` actually work, we additionally have to annotate with `@Priority(APPLICATION)`
<3> With `@Inject` `Instance<IdentityStore> identityStores` CDI will give us a collection of all identity stores in the application. In the case of this example that will be the store behind `@DatabaseIdentityStoreDefinition` and our `CustomIdentityStore`. We can the iterate over those stores in our code, and offer the credentials (the username and password in this example) to each of them.

There are various result outcomes possible.

`NOT_VALIDATED` means the store did not try to validate the credentials at all. In most situations that status is set when the store in question doesnt't handle a given credential. I.e. it only handles say `JWTCredentials` and not `UsernamePasswordCredential`.

`INVALID` means the store tried to validate the credentials, and validation failed. For example the username and password were wrong.

In our custom handler code here we return an `INVALID_RESULT` for the first store that fails, as we want all stores to validate successfully here. If validation does succeed (the outcome is `VALID` then) we grab the groups it returned and store in a set.

NOTE: Identity stores also have a capability to query it for roles directly, without validating credentials. We haven't used that feature here.

Eventually we return a result based on the `CallerPrincipal` from the last successful validation result, and all the collected groups.

NOTE: In our example it doesn't matter from which validation result we grab the `CallerPrincipal` as it's all the one with name "pete" here. In general identity stores may transform the name from the input credential (for example "pete") to something else (for example "Pete Anderson").

==== Test the application

----

The resource that we defined above required only two roles to access it (`user` and `caller2`), but our custom identity store also returned `caller1`. The resource we created tests for this, and as it appears, we indeed had this role.

NOTE: If we hadn't declared `caller1` in `web.xml` (or via an annotation), the test for `caller1` might have returned false. This is however server dependent.



== Securing an endpoint with a custom authentication mechanism and a custom identity store

In the following example, we'll be securing a REST endpoint using a custom authentication mechanism. A custom authentication mechanism is one we provide ourselves, instead of using one provided by Jakarta Security (such as the Basic HTTP authentication mechanism).

You'll learn how to:

include::partial$list-item-learn-security-constraints.adoc[]
. Define (and implicitly set) a custom authentication mechanism
. Define (and implicitly set) a custom identity store
include::partial$list-item-learn-security-context.adoc[]

=== Write the application

include::partial$rest-resource-class.adoc[]

==== Define the authentication mechanism

Let's now define a simple authentication mechanism that the security system can use to interact with the caller who tries to access a resource:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomAuthenticationMechanism implements HttpAuthenticationMechanism {

    @Inject
    private IdentityStoreHandler identityStoreHandler;

    @Override
    public AuthenticationStatus validateRequest(
        HttpServletRequest request,
        HttpServletResponse response,
        HttpMessageContext httpMessageContext) throws AuthenticationException {

        var callerName = request.getHeader("callername"); <1>
        var password = request.getHeader("callerpassword");

        if (callerName == null || password == null) { <2>
            return httpMessageContext.doNothing();
        }

        var result = identityStoreHandler.validate( <4>
            new UsernamePasswordCredential(callerName, password)); <3>

        if (result.getStatus() != VALID) {
            return httpMessageContext.responseUnauthorized();
        }

        return httpMessageContext.notifyContainerAboutLogin( <5>
            result.getCallerPrincipal(),
            result.getCallerGroups());
    }

}
----

This custom authentication mechanism interacts with the caller by grabbing two headers from the request: `callername` and `callerpassword`. (1) In case any of them are `null`, we return a special status; the "do nothing" status. (2) This means there has been no request or attempt to do authentication. If the resource the caller is trying to access is not protected, the caller can access it anonymously. If it is proteced, the caller will not be able to access it.

When the two required headers are provided by the caller, we create a `UsernamePasswordCredential` out of their values (3) and pass that into the injected `IdentityStoreHandler`. (4) We saw how this type of handler worked in the example <<Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication and a custom algorithm for handling multiple identity stores>>.

NOTE: An authentication mechanism in Jakarta Security is not strictly required to delegate the credential validation to the identity store handler. However not doing so is considered bad practice, as it would restrict developers from things like inserting extra identity stores into the chain that can do things like adding extra groups.

If the credentials validated correctly, we use the `HttpMessageContext` to communicate the details of the authenticated caller to the container. (5)

NOTE: In Jakarta Security the two basic items that make up an "authenticated identity" are just a caller principal (of type `Principal`) and a set of groups (of type `String`). Via a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface[Service Provider Interface,role=external,window=_blank] a specific Jakarta EE product (such as WildFly or GlassFish) is able to receive these two items and then stores it internally in some way.

----

Let's take a quick look at the actual test:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class RestCustomAuthCustomStoreIT extends ITBase {

    @ArquillianResource
    private URL baseUrl;

    /**
     * Test the call to a protected REST service
     *
     * @throws Exception when a serious error occurs.
     */
    @RunAsClient
    @Test
    public void testRestCall() throws Exception {
        webClient.addRequestHeader("callername", "john");
        webClient.addRequestHeader("callerpassword", "secret1");

        TextPage page = webClient.getPage(baseUrl + "rest/resource");
        String content = page.getContent();

        System.out.println(content);
    }
}
----

include::partial$inspect-app.adoc[]

The `webClient.addRequestHeader()` calls used here make sure that the headers for our custom authentication mechanism are added to the request. The authentication mechanism that we defined for our applications reads those headers, extracts the username and password from them, and consults our identity store with them.




== Securing an endpoint with Form authentication and remember-me

In the following example, we'll secure a REST endpoint using Form authentication and remember-me.

Remember-me is a facility where an authenticated identity can be remembered beyond the scope of an HTTP session. This happens via
a separate cookie that has a longer life-time than the cookie used for the HTTP session (and the session itself on the server).

You'll learn how to:

include::partial$list-item-learn-security-constraints.adoc[]
. Use the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/authentication/mechanism/http/formauthenticationmechanismdefinition[Form authentication mechanism,role=external,window=_blank]

=== Write the application

include::partial$rest-resource-class.adoc[]

==== Declare the security constraints

include::partial$declare-security-constraints.adoc[]

==== Declare the authentication mechanism

We'll use the same authentication mechanism declaration as we used for <<Securing an endpoint with Form authentication>>

==== Enable remember-me

In Jakarta Security, there are several services available through CDI Interceptors footnote:[Technically Jakarta Interceptors is an API separate from CDI, but in modern applications they are used exclusively with CDI, hence we use the term "CDI Interceptors" here.], one of which is the remember-me service. Remember-me can be transparently applied to basically every authentication mechanism. In CDI, it's trivial to add Interceptors to beans that we define ourselves, but a little less trivial to add to provided beans. In this section we explain how to do this via a CDI extension.


For this example, we'll add the CDI extension interface (1) to our application config class:

[source,java]
-----
@ApplicationScoped
@FormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
    loginToContinue = @LoginToContinue(
        loginPage="/login.html",
        errorPage="/login-error.html"
    )
)
@ApplicationPath("/rest")
public class ApplicationConfig extends Application
    implements BuildCompatibleExtension { <1>

    @Enhancement(
        types = HttpAuthenticationMechanism.class,
        withSubtypes = true) <2>
    public void addRememberMe(ClassConfig httpAuthenticationMechanism) {
        httpAuthenticationMechanism.addAnnotation(
            RememberMe.Literal.INSTANCE); <3>
    }
}
-----

CDI allows us to enhance classes using a method annotated with the `@Enhancement` annotation and as attribute the class we're seeking to enhance. For our example that will be a sub-type of the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface (we know the bean enabled by `FormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` will implement the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface), hence we set the `withSubtypes` attribute to `true`. (2)

Within the method we can then programmatically add the `@RememberMe` annotation used to bind the remember-me interceptor to a class. In the example here we use the default instance (which has all attributes set to their defaults). There are attributes for setting various aspects of the cookie, such as its name, whether it should be secure and http only, and perhaps most importantly the max age of the cookie (default is one day).

==== Define the remember-me identity store

For remember-me to work a token has to be created that is used as a credential to authenticate right away instead of invoking the authentication mechanism that is being intercepted. Jakarta Security uses a special identity store for this; the `RememberMeIdentityStore`. This type of identity store is exclusively used by the remember-me feature, hence it's a different type from `IdentityStore`.

Jakarta Security does not ship with any provided remember-me identity store, but for demonstration purposes we can easily create one ourselves.

The following shows an example:

[source,java]
-----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomRememberMeIdentityStore implements RememberMeIdentityStore {

    private final Map<String, CredentialValidationResult> tokenToIdentityMap =
        new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    @Override
    public String generateLoginToken(
        CallerPrincipal callerPrincipal, Set<String> groups) { <1>
        var token = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

        tokenToIdentityMap.put(
            token,
            new CredentialValidationResult(callerPrincipal, groups));

        return token;
    }

    @Override
    public CredentialValidationResult validate(
        RememberMeCredential credential) { <2>
        if (tokenToIdentityMap.containsKey(credential.getToken())) {
            return tokenToIdentityMap.get(credential.getToken());
        }

        return INVALID_RESULT;
    }

    @Override
    public void removeLoginToken(String token) { <3>
        tokenToIdentityMap.remove(token);
    }

}
-----

The `RememberMeIdentityStore` needs to perform 3 tasks.

It first needs to generate a token representing a caller principal and a set of groups. The caller principal and the set of groups are the ones set by the authentication mechanism right after the caller successfully authenticated. In our example (1) here we're generating a random UUID that's used as a key in an application scoped map.

NOTE: Storing the authenticated identity (principal and groups) in an application scoped map is just an example. Other options could be storing it in a database or key-value store, encrypting the principal and groups, or generating some kind of JSON Web Token (JWT).

NOTE: When storing the Principal, care must be taken that the Principal could be an elaborate custom Principal containing many more fields than just `name`.

The next thing that must be done is essentially similar to what a normal identity store does: validating a `Credential`. For a `RememberMeIdentityStore` this will always be of type `RememberMeCredential` with `getToken()` returning a token of the kind that was generated in `generateLoginToken()`. In our example (2) we're just using the token as key in our map.

Finally we can provide behaviour to remove the login token (and essentially invalidate it) via the `removeLoginToken` method. This method is called when a caller explicitly logs out. In our example (3) we just remove the token from our map.

NOTE: When storing the principal and groups in a token that we send to the client we can't always easily invalidate it when the caller logs out; the caller can always keep the token and send it again.

    @ArquillianResource
    private URL baseUrl;

        System.out.println(loginPage.asXml());

        // Response is login form, so we can authenticate
        HtmlForm form = loginPage.getForms()
                                 .get(0);

        form.getInputByName("j_username")
            .setValueAttribute("john");

        form.getInputByName("j_password")
            .setValueAttribute("secret1");

        // After logging in, we should get the actual resource response
        TextPage page = form.getInputByValue("Submit")
                   .click();

        System.out.println(page.getContent());

        // Remove all cookies (specially the JSESSONID), except for the
        // JREMEMBERMEID cookie which carries the token to login again
        for (Cookie cookie : webClient.getCookieManager().getCookies()) {
            if (!"JREMEMBERMEID".equals(cookie.getName())) {
                webClient.getCookieManager().removeCookie(cookie);
            }
        }

        // Should get the resource response, and not the login form
        TextPage pageAgain = webClient.getPage(baseUrl + "/rest/resource");

        System.out.println(pageAgain.getContent());
    }
}
----

include::partial$inspect-app.adoc[]

The test first sends a request here to the protected resource, and the server responds with the HTML form we defined above. Using the `HtmlUnit` API, it's easy to navigate the HTML DOM, fill out the username and password in the form, and programmatically click the Submit button. The form posts back to a special "j_security_check" URL, where the authentication mechanism receives the request and retrieves the username and password from the POST data, much like the Basic authentication mechanism retrieves them from the HTTP headers.

Then we delete all cookies, specifically the `JSESSIONID` cookie that keeps the session that the form authentication mechanism uses to remember the authenticated identity. The test then does another request, and this time the value from the `JREMEMBERMEID` cookie is used to login.




== Securing an endpoint with a custom authentication mechanism, a custom identity store and remember-me

In the following example, we'll secure a REST endpoint using custom authentication and remember-me.

Remember-me is a facility where an authenticated identity can be remembered beyond the scope of an HTTP session. This happens via
a separate cookie that has a longer life-time than the cookie used for the HTTP session (and the session itself on the server).

You'll learn how to:

. Define (and implicitly set) a custom identity store
include::partial$list-item-learn-security-context.adoc[]

=== Write the application

include::partial$rest-resource-class.adoc[]

==== Define the authentication mechanism

Let's now define a simple authentication mechanism that the security system can use to interact with the caller who tries to access a resource and specifically make sure the RememberMe feature is used:

[source,java]
----
@RememberMe <6>
@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomAuthenticationMechanism implements HttpAuthenticationMechanism {

    @Inject
    private IdentityStoreHandler identityStoreHandler;

    @Override
    public AuthenticationStatus validateRequest(
        HttpServletRequest request,
        HttpServletResponse response,
        HttpMessageContext httpMessageContext) throws AuthenticationException {

        var callerName = request.getHeader("callername"); <1>
        var password = request.getHeader("callerpassword");

        if (callerName == null || password == null) { <2>
            return httpMessageContext.doNothing();
        }

        var result = identityStoreHandler.validate( <4>
            new UsernamePasswordCredential(callerName, password)); <3>

        if (result.getStatus() != VALID) {
            return httpMessageContext.responseUnauthorized();
        }

        return httpMessageContext.notifyContainerAboutLogin( <5>
            result.getCallerPrincipal(),
            result.getCallerGroups());
    }

}
----

NOTE: This is the same custom authentication mechanism that was used in <<Securing an endpoint with a custom authentication mechanism and a custom identity store>>, but with the `@RememberMe` annotation added.

This custom authentication mechanism interacts with the caller by grabbing two headers from the request: `callername` and `callerpassword`. (1) In case any of them are `null`, we return a special status; the "do nothing" status. (2) This means there has been no request or attempt to do authentication. If the resource the caller is trying to access is not protected, the caller can access it anonymously. If it is proteced, the caller will not be able to access it.

When the two required headers are provided by the caller, we create a `UsernamePasswordCredential` out of their values (3) and pass that into the injected `IdentityStoreHandler`. (4) We've seen how such handler worked in the example <<Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication and a custom algorithm for handling multiple identity stores>>.

NOTE: An authentication mechanism in Jakarta Security is not strictly required to delegate the credential validation to the identity store handler. However not doing so is considered bad practice, as it would restrict developers from things like inserting extra identity stores into the chain that can do things like adding extra groups.

If the credentials validated correctly, we use the `HttpMessageContext` to communicate the details of the authenticated caller to the container. (5)

NOTE: In Jakarta Security the two basic items that make up an "authenticated identity" are just a caller principal (of type `Principal`) and a set of groups (of type `String`). Via a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider_interface[Service Provider Interface,role=external,window=_blank] a specific Jakarta EE product (such as WildFly or GlassFish) is able to receive these two items and then stores it internally in some way.

We annotate our custom authentication mechanism with the `@RememberMe` annotation to enable the remember-me feature for use with this authentication mechanism. In the example here we don't set any attributes (all of them have default values). There are attributes for setting various aspects of the cookie used for remember-me, such as its name, whether it should be secure and http only, and perhaps most importantly the max age of the cookie (default is one day).

NOTE: Instead of using the `@RememberMe` annotation here, we could also have used the same extension that was used in <<Securing an endpoint with Form authentication and remember-me>> to enable the remember-me feature. The annotation however is a little bit easier to use.

include::partial$inspect-app.adoc[]

The `webClient.addRequestHeader()` calls used here make sure that the headers for our custom authentication mechanism are added to the request. The authentication mechanism that we defined for our applications reads those headers, extracts the username and password from them, and consults our identity store with them.

The test sends a request here to the protected resource along with the headers we mentioned above, and the server responds with the right content.

Then we delete all cookies, except for the `JREMEMBERMEID` cookie, and we unset all headers that we used before. The test then does another request, and this time the value from the `JREMEMBERMEID` cookie is used to login.




== Securing an endpoint with OpenID Connect authentication

In the following example, we'll be securing a REST endpoint using OpenID Connect authentication.

With https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID[OpenID Connect,role=external,window=_blank] authentication a caller is redirected to a third party server, typically a public one such as Google, Facebook, Linkedin, Apple, and more, but it can be a private one as well. The caller authenticates with that third party server, and is then redirected back along with a token. Our server than validates that token, and if it's valid the caller is considered authenticated.

You'll learn how to:

include::partial$list-item-learn-security-constraints.adoc[]
. Use the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/authentication/mechanism/http/openidauthenticationmechanismdefinition[OpenID Connect authentication mechanism,role=external,window=_blank]
. Define (and implicitly set) a custom identity store used for authorization only
include::partial$list-item-learn-security-context.adoc[]

=== Write the application

include::partial$rest-resource-class.adoc[]

==== Declare the security constraints

include::partial$declare-security-constraints.adoc[]

[source,java]
----
@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
    providerURI = "https://localhost:8443/openid-connect-server-webapp", <1>
    clientId = "client", <2>
    clientSecret = "secret", <3>
    redirectToOriginalResource = true <4>
)
@ApplicationScoped

public class ApplicationConfig extends Application {

}

include::partial$declare-authentication-mechanism.adoc[]

Contrary to the Basic HTTP authentication mechanism and the Form authentication mechanism, the OpenID Connect authentication mechanism requires a third party server that performs the actual authentication. Such third party server is called the OpenID Connect Provider (OIDC provider or OpenID Provider are also used). After authentication this provider handles user consent and and issues a token. The client requesting a user's authentication is called a Relying Party. In the case of Jakarta EE and Jakarta Security, the Jakarta EE server running the OpenID Connect authentication mechanism is a Relying Party.

To use this authentication mechanism, Jakarta Security provides the `@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation, for which we typically need 3 mandatory configuration items as shown in the example code above.

The first is the `providerURI` (1), which points to the third party OpenID Connect Provider. In this example we use `https://localhost:8443/openid-connect-server-webapp`, which is the URL on which the example code has installed and started a local OpenID Connect provider called "Mitre". Whenever a caller accesses a protected resource, that caller is redirected to that OpenID Connect Provider.

The OpenId authentication mechanism needs to identify itself to the OpenID Connect Provider via a username/password (called `clientId` (2) and `clientSecret` (3)). We use "client" respectively "secret" here for those, which are the credentials for a default client that is available in Mitre.

After a caller successfully authenticates with the OpenID Connect Provider, that caller is redirected back to a URL on the Relying Party (our Jakarta EE server). This is called the "callback URL" and can be set via the `redirectURI` attribute. The default value is `$\{baseURL}/Callback`, where `$\{baseURL}` expands to the context-root of the application that uses Jakarta Security, for example `https://localhost:8080/openid-client` in our example. This exact URI must be known to Mitre. Mitre (and any OpenID Connect Provider in general) never redirects to unknown URIs.

By default, after the caller is redirected back to the Relying Party (our Jakarta EE server), the resource behind `/Callback` is invoked. When the attribute `redirectToOriginalResource` (4) is set to `true` however, the caller is once again redirected to the URL originally requested and which triggered the authentication process.

NOTE: When `redirectToOriginalResource` is set to to `true` it's not necessary to actually map anything to the callback URL (for example a Servlet or a REST resource). The authentication mechanism is invoked before the resource mapped to the callback URL is invoked, so if the authentication mechanism always redirects it never invokes this resource and the resource therefore doesn't need to actually exist.

==== Define the identity store

In many cases the OpenID Connect Provider has no knowledge of the application for which it authenticates the caller, and therefore does not normally provide any logical groups for the authenticated user. Those groups are application specific after all. We therefore define an additional identity store that does provide those groups for a caller.

NOTE: Despite not being typical, Jakarta Security supports getting the groups via the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/authentication/mechanism/http/openidauthenticationmechanismdefinition#claimsDefinition()[claimsDefinition,role=external,window=_blank] attribute of the `@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation. This can be used to set a claim name (default is "groups"). Jakarta Security then tries to find this name in the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/identitystore/openid/accesstoken[AccessToken,role=external,window=_blank], https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/identitystore/openid/identitytoken[IdentityToken,role=external,window=_blank], or in the info returned by the `/userinfo` endpoint of the OpenId Connect Provider. Providers often need special configuration to return group claims.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class AuthorizationIdentityStore implements IdentityStore {

    private Map<String, Set<String>> groupsPerCaller =
        Map.of("user", Set.of("user")); <2>

    @Override
    public Set<ValidationType> validationTypes() {
        return EnumSet.of(PROVIDE_GROUPS); <1>
    }

    @Override
    public Set<String> getCallerGroups(
        CredentialValidationResult validationResult) { <3>
        return groupsPerCaller.get(validationResult.getCallerPrincipal().getName());
    }

}
----

This identity store is set to `PROVIDE_GROUPS` (1) only, which means the default `IdentityStoreHandler` will consult this identity store for groups after another identity store has successfully validated the credentials. For our example here we create a `Map` (2) with as key the caller principal name, and as value the set of groups. When the `IdentityStoreHandler` comes asking for the groups (3) of caller "user", a set with just the group "user" is returned.

NOTE: As validation of the `IdentityToken` that's returned by the OpenID Connect Provider is integral to the OpenID Connect flow and not application specific, developers don't have to provide or define an identity store explicitly for this. Such a store is provided by Jakarta Security as an implementation detail, and automatically activated when the OpenID Connect authentication mechanism is activated.

Mitre is a Spring application that uses the `javax.*` namespace. We therefore need a Tomcat from the 9.x series, which is available as a zip file from the Maven coordinates `org.apache.tomcat:tomcat:9.0.76`. Likewise, Mitre is available from `org.mitre:openid-connect-server-webapp:1.3.4`. We simply need to unzip Tomcat, and unzip Mitre into its `webapps` folder. We also need to update Tomcat with the JAXB standalone libraries (see full example code).

----

Out of the box Mitre runs on HTTP, but since we're using HTTPS instead we need to configure it to run on HTTPS using the `server-config.xml` file. We also need to tell it about the exact callback URL that we discussed above (`http://localhost:8080/openid-client/Callback`), which can be done in `clients.sql`. Tomcat has to be configured to run on HTTPS as well, which requires updating `server.xml` and providing it with a keystore.

Tomcat, and with it Mitre, can be started by executing `[tomcat dir]/bin/startup.sh`.

----

include::partial$inspect-app.adoc[]

After the test requests our protected resource at "/rest/resource" (1), the OpenID Connect authentication mechanism redirects to Mitre, which will respond with a login page. The test programmically sets the fields `j_username` and `j_password`, (2) and then clicks submits (3). After confirming (4), Mitre will redirect the test code back to the `/Callback` URL, which will redirect back to the original resource at "/rest/resource".







== Securing an endpoint with Basic authentication and an LDAP identity store

In the following example, we'll secure a REST endpoint using Basic authentication and the LDAP identity store that is provided by Jakarta Security.

You'll learn how to:

include::partial$list-item-learn-security-constraints.adoc[]
include::partial$list-item-learn-basic-authentication.adoc[]
. Use the provided https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/apidocs/jakarta.security/jakarta/security/enterprise/identitystore/ldapidentitystoredefinition[LdapIdentityStoreDefinition,role=external,window=_blank]
. Populate and configure the identity store
include::partial$list-item-learn-security-context.adoc[]


=== Write the application

include::partial$rest-resource-class.adoc[]

==== Declare the authentication mechanism and identity store

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
@BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
    realmName = "basicAuth"
)
@LdapIdentityStoreDefinition(
    url = "ldap://localhost:40000",
    callerBaseDn = "ou=caller,dc=jakartaee",
    groupSearchBase = "ou=group,dc=jakartaee",
    groupSearchFilter = "(&(member=%s)(objectclass=groupofnames))"
)
@ApplicationPath("/rest")
public class ApplicationConfig extends Application {

----

include::partial$declare-authentication-mechanism.adoc[]

Likewise, to declare the usage of a specific identity store, Jakarta EE provides `[XYZ]StoreDefinition` annotations.

The annotations can be put on any bean, but in a REST application it fits particularly well on the `Application` subclass that also declares the path for REST resources.

You can use the provided `@LdapIdentityStoreDefinition` with any authentication mechanism that validates username/password credentials. LDAP structures are very open-ended, and there's a lot of possible ways to model callers, their passwords, and their groups. We'll present one way here, where we'll define a `caller.jakartaee` object, that contains the caller name and password, and a `group.jakartaee` object that contains the group name and a list of all callers in that group.

For this structure we need 3 attributes to be defined:

. `callerBaseDn` - Used for credential validation using "direct binding", with the default caller name being "uid".
. `groupSearchBase` - The object root used to search for groups of the caller
. `groupSearchFilter` - The subtree to search for groups



==== Populating the identity store

In order to use the identity store, we need to put some data in an LDAP server. The following code shows one way how to do that:

[source,java]

    url = "ldap://localhost:40000",

    groupSearchBase = "ou=group,dc=jakartaee",
    groupSearchFilter = "(&(member=%s)(objectclass=groupofnames))"
)
@DeclareRoles("user")
@ApplicationPath("/rest")
public class ApplicationConfig extends Application {

    private InMemoryDirectoryServer directoryServer;

    public void onStart(@Observes @Initialized(ApplicationScoped.class) Object applicationContext) {
        try {
            InMemoryDirectoryServerConfig config = new InMemoryDirectoryServerConfig("dc=jakartaee");
            config.setListenerConfigs(
                new InMemoryListenerConfig("myListener", null, 40000, null, null, null));

            directoryServer = new InMemoryDirectoryServer(config);

            directoryServer.importFromLDIF(true,
                new LDIFReader(new ByteArrayInputStream("""

        } catch (LDAPException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(e);
        }
    }

}
----

The code above uses an in-memory LDAP server called Unboundid that we start on port 40000. We populate it using embedded LDIF, which is a popular format to configure LDAP servers.

In-depth explanation of LDAP itself is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but we'll briefly explain the process here. When a caller authenticates with username "john" and password "secret1", our LDAP identity store will construct the full name "uid=john,ou=caller,dc=jakartaee" using `callerNameAttribute` ("uid" as a default), and `callerBaseDn` ("ou=caller,dc=jakartaee" here). The store then uses the LDAP 'Bind' operation and directly attempts to "log in" as that user to the LDAP server. Unlike the Database identity store, the LDAP store doesn't look up and compare the passwords. If the aforementioned login succeeds, the credentials are assumed to be correct.

The LDAP store will then search for groups using the `javax.naming.directory.DirContext.search()` method, with the `groupSearchBase` value ("ou=group,dc=jakartaee") and the formatted value from `groupSearchFilter` ("(&(member=uid=john,ou=caller,dc=jakartaee)(objectclass=groupofnames))") as parameters. The LDAP server will subsequently return "cn=user,ou=group,dc=jakartaee" for our example. From this the value of `groupNameAttribute` (defaults to "cn") is taken, which resolves to "user" here.

Contrary to the Basic HTTP authentication mechanism, the Form authentication mechanism allows us to customize the login dialog (the process between the caller and the authentication mechanism) and to keep track of the authenticated session on the server (using a cookie). This also allows us to logout, something that for unknown reasons has never been specified for Basic HTTP authentication.

Contrary to the regular Form authentication mechanism, the Custom Form authentication mechanism lets us customize the login dialog even more by having the ability to execute custom code between the postback of a login form and the form authentication mechanism taking the provided credentials.

To use this authentication method, we need to designate a path to a resource that is relative to our application. The authentication mechanism will redirect the caller to this resource when authentication is required. The resource can be anything, but a postback should eventually lead to some code being executed that continues the authentication dialog. For example a plain .html file or .jsp file combined with  a Filter, or a Faces view with a backing bean.


==== Define the authentication mechanism's view and backing code

For this example we'll use a Faces view with a backing bean:

[source,xml]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" xmlns:h="jakarta.faces.html">
    <h:head>
        <title>Login to continue</title>
    </h:head>
    <h:body>
        <h1>Login to continue</h1>

        <h:messages />

        <h:form id="form">
            <div>
                <h:outputLabel for="username" value="Username" />
                <h:inputText id="username" value="#{loginBacking.username}"/>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h:outputLabel for="password" value="Password" />
                <h:inputSecret id="password" value="#{loginBacking.password}"/>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h:commandButton value="Login" type="submit" action="#{loginBacking.login}" />
            </div>
        </h:form>
    </h:body>
</html>
----

[source,java]
----
@Named
@RequestScoped
public class LoginBacking {

    @Inject
    private SecurityContext securityContext;

    @Inject
    private FacesContext facesContext;

    @NotNull
    @Size(min = 3, max = 15, message="Username must be between 3 and 15 characters")
    private String username;

    @NotNull
    @Size(min = 5, max = 50, message="Password must be between 5 and 50 characters")
    private String password;

    public void login() {
        switch (
            // Continue the authentication dialog manually by invoking the authenticate()
            // method. The form authentication picks this up, just like a post to j_security does.
            securityContext.authenticate(
                getRequest(),
                getResponse(),
                withParams()
                    .credential(new UsernamePasswordCredential(username, new Password(password))))) {

            case SEND_CONTINUE:

                // Authentication mechanism has send a redirect, should not
                // send anything to response from Faces now.
                facesContext.responseComplete();
                return;

            case SEND_FAILURE:

                addError("Login failed");
                return;

            default:
        }
    }

    // getters/setters + utility methods omitted
}
----

The view itself is quite similar to the HTML page we used for the form in <<Securing an endpoint with Form authentication>>. The main difference is bindings of the form fields to a (CDI) backing bean. The bean side of the binding has Jakarta Validation constraints applied to it; this allows for fine-grained validation of some general requirements of the credentials without actually attempting authentication.

If this initial validation passes, we arrive in the `login()` method. For our example the only thing we need to do here is signaling that we want to continue the authentication dialog (the process or interaction between the caller and the authentication mechanism), and when doing so provide the credentials that we earlier obtained in a custom way.

We have two important outcomes to handle. `SEND_CONTINUE` effectively means the credentials were validated successfully, and the caller is therefore directed to the resource that was originally requested. `SEND_FAILURE` means the opposite; the credentials were not validated successfully. By just returning from our callback method in the last case the form will be redisplayed, albeit with the error message added.

NOTE: `NOT_DONE` and `SUCCESS` are two other outcomes, but we don't have to handle them here. `NOT_DONE` only applies to pre-emptive authentication, but we're doing explicit (forced, mandatory) authentication here. `SUCCESS` means we can go ahead and render the page, which is exactly what happens if we don't do anything.

See xref:web:webapp/webapp.adoc#_getting_started_with_web_applications[Getting Started with Web Applications] for more information on running `.xhtml` files and their backing beans.



==== Define the identity store

Finally, let's define a basic identity store that the security system can use to validate provided credentials for Form authentication:

[source,java]
-----
@ApplicationScoped
public class CustomIdentityStore implements IdentityStore {

    public CredentialValidationResult validate(UsernamePasswordCredential usernamePasswordCredential) {
        if (usernamePasswordCredential.compareTo("john", "secret1")) {
            return new CredentialValidationResult("john", Set.of("user", "caller"));
        }

        return INVALID_RESULT;
    }

}
-----

This identity store only validates the single identity (user) "john", with password "secret1" and roles "user" and "caller". Defining this kind of identity store is often the simplest way to get started. Note that Jakarta Security doesn't define a simple identity store out of the box, because there are questions about whether that would promote security best practices.

==== Test the application

:app-name: restCustomFormAuthCustomStore
include::partial$test-github.adoc[]

[source]

john : true
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 9.272 s - in jakartaee.examples.focused.security.restCustomFormAuthCustomStore.RestCustomFormAuthCustomStoreIT
----

Let's take a quick look at the actual test:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@RunAsClient
public class RestCustomFormAuthCustomStoreIT extends ITBase {

    @ArquillianResource
    private URL baseUrl;

    /**
     * Test the call to a protected REST service
     *
     * @throws Exception when a serious error occurs.
     */
    @RunAsClient
    @Test
    public void testRestCall() throws Exception {
        HtmlPage loginPage = webClient.getPage(baseUrl + "/rest/resource");
        System.out.println(loginPage.asXml());

        HtmlForm form = loginPage.getForms()
                                 .get(0);

        form.getInputByName("form:username")
            .setValueAttribute("john");

        form.getInputByName("form:password")
            .setValueAttribute("secret1");

        TextPage page = form.getInputByValue("Login")
                            .click();

        System.out.println(page.getContent());
    }
}
----

include::partial$inspect-app.adoc[]

The test first sends a request here to the protected resource, and the server responds with the rendered version of the Faces view form we defined above. Using the `HtmlUnit` API, it's easy to navigate the HTML DOM, fill out the username and password in the form, and programmatically click the `Login` button. The form posts back to the same URL it was requested from. Faces will detect this postback and will orchestrate the validation using Jakarta Validation and invoking the CDI based backing bean.
