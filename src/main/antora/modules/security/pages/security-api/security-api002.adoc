== Overview of the HTTP Authentication Mechanism Interface

The `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface defines an SPI for writing authentication mechanisms that can be provided with an application and deployed using CDI.
Developers can write their own implementations of `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` to support specific authentication token types or protocols.
There are also several built-in authentication mechanisms that perform BASIC, FORM, and Custom FORM authentication.

The built-in authentication mechanisms are enabled and configured through the use of one of the following annotations:

* `BasicAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` -- implements BASIC authentication that conforms to the behavior of the servlet container when BASIC <auth-method> is declared in web.xml.

* `FormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` -- implements FORM authentication that conforms to the behavior of the servlet container when the FORM <auth-method> is declared in web.xml.

* `CustomFormAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` -- implements a modified version of FORM authentication in which custom handling replaces the POST to j_security_check.

An implementation of HttpAuthenticationMechanism must be a CDI bean to be recognized and deployed at runtime, and is assumed to be normal scoped.
During bean discovery, the servlet container looks for a bean that implements `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` -- there should be only one per application -- and, if found, arranges for it to be deployed to authenticate the application's callers.

The servlet container leverages Jakarta Authentication to deploy authentication mechanisms.
The container provides a Jakarta Authentication Server Auth Module (SAM) that can delegate to an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`, and arranges for that "bridge" SAM to be registered with the Jakarta Authentication `AuthConfigFactory`.
At runtime, normal Jakarta Authentication processing invokes the bridge SAM, which then delegates to the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` to perform the authentication and drive any necessary dialog with the caller, or with third parties involved in the authentication protocol flow.

The HttpAuthenticationMechanism interface defines the following three methods, which correspond to the three methods defined by the Jakarta Authentication ServerAuth interface.
When one of the Jakarta Authentication methods is invoked on the bridge SAM, it delegates to the corresponding method of the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`.
Although the method names are identical, the method signatures are not; the bridge SAM maps back and forth between the parameters passed to it by the Jakarta Authentication framework, and the parameters expected by an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`.

* `validateRequest()` -- validate an incoming request and authenticates the caller.

* `secureResponse()` -- (optional if default is sufficient) secure a response message.

* `cleanSubject()` -- (optional if default is sufficient) clear the provided Subject of principals and credentials.

Only the `validateRequest()` method must be implemented by an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`; the interface includes default implementations for `secureResponse()` and `cleanSubject()` that will often be sufficient.

The following annotations can be used to add additional behaviors to an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`:

* `AutoApplySession` -- indicates that the Jakarta Authentication `registerSession` functionality should be enabled such that the the caller's authenticated identity is persisted in the caller's servlet session.

* `LoginToContinue` -- mechanism to specify properties for FORM login -- login page, error page, etc.
The built-in FORM authentication mechanisms use LoginToContinue to configure the necessary parameters.

* `RememberMe` -- specifies that a `RememberMe` identity store should be used to enable `RememberMe` functionality for the authentication mechanism.
