== Basic Security Tasks for Enterprise Applications

System administrators, application developers, bean providers, and deployers are responsible for administering security for enterprise applications.
The basic security tasks are as follows:

* Setting up a database of users and assigning them to the proper group

* Setting up identity propagation

* Setting GlassFish Server properties that enable the applications to run properly.
Note that the the *Default Principal To Role Mapping* setting is enabled by default in the GlassFish Server Administration Console.

* Annotating the classes and methods of an enterprise application to provide information about which methods need to have restricted access

The sections on the security examples in this chapter and the previous chapter explain how to perform these tasks.
