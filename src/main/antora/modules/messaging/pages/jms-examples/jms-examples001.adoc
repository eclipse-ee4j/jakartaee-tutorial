== Building and Running Jakarta Messaging Examples

The examples are in the `_jakartaee-examples_/tutorial/jms/` directory.

To build and run each example:

. Use NetBeans IDE or Maven to compile, package, and in some cases deploy the example.

. Use NetBeans IDE, Maven, or the `appclient` command to run the application client, or use the browser to run the web application examples.

Before you deploy or run the examples, you need to create resources for them.
Some examples have a `glassfish-resources.xml` file that is used to create resources for that example and others.
You can use the `asadmin` command to create the resources.

To use the `asadmin` and `appclient` commands, you need to put the GlassFish Server `bin` directories in your command path, as described in xref:intro:usingexamples/usingexamples.adoc#_glassfish_server_installation_tips[GlassFish Server Installation Tips].
