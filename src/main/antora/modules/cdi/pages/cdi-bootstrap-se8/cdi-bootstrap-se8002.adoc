== Configuring the CDI Container

The configuration of the `SeContainerInitializer` instance allows the explicit addition of elements into an internal *synthetic bean archive*.
The synthetic bean archive represents the set of beans that have been loaded while initializing the container.
The contents of the synthetic bean archive depend on whether discovery is enabled:

* If discovery is enabled, the synthetic bean archive is created using standard bean discovery rules and contains a superset of all JAR files on the classpath.
Archives that do not include a `beans.xml` file are excluded.

* If discovery is disabled, and beans are added programmatically, the synthetic bean archive contains only the beans that have been programmatically added.
