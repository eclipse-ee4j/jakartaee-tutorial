== About CDI Managed Beans

A managed bean is implemented by a Java class, which is called its bean class.
A top-level Java class is a managed bean if it is defined to be a managed bean by any other Jakarta EE technology specification, such as the Jakarta Faces technology specification, or if it meets all the following conditions.

* It is not a nonstatic inner class.

* It is a concrete class or is annotated `@Decorator`.

* It is not annotated with an enterprise bean component-defining annotation or declared as an enterprise bean class in `ejb-jar.xml`.

* It has an appropriate constructor.
That is, one of the following is the case.

** The class has a constructor with no parameters.

** The class declares a constructor annotated `@Inject`.

No special declaration, such as an annotation, is required to define a managed bean.
