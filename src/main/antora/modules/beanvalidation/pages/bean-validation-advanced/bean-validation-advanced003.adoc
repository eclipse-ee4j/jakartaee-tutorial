== Grouping Constraints

Constraints may be added to one or more groups.
Constraint groups are used to create subsets of constraints so that only certain constraints will be validated for a particular object.
By default, all constraints are included in the `Default` constraint group.

Constraint groups are represented by interfaces.

[source,java]
----
public interface Employee {}

public interface Contractor {}
----

Constraint groups can inherit from other groups.

[source,java]
----
public interface Manager extends Employee {}
----

When a constraint is added to an element, the constraint declares the groups to which that constraint belongs by specifying the class name of the group interface name in the `groups` element of the constraint.

[source,java]
----
@NotNull(groups=Employee.class)
Phone workPhone;
----

Multiple groups can be declared by surrounding the groups with braces (`{` and `}`) and separating the groups' class names with commas.

[source,java]
----
@NotNull(groups={ Employee.class, Contractor.class })
Phone workPhone;
----

If a group inherits from another group, validating that group results in validating all constraints declared as part of the supergroup.
For example, validating the `Manager` group results in the `workPhone` field being validated, because `Employee` is a superinterface of `Manager`.

=== Customizing Group Validation Order

By default, constraint groups are validated in no particular order.
There are cases in which some groups should be validated before others.
For example, in a particular class, basic data should be validated before more advanced data.

To set the validation order for a group, add a `jakarta.validation.GroupSequence` annotation to the interface definition, listing the order in which the validation should occur.

[source,java]
----
@GroupSequence({Default.class, ExpensiveValidationGroup.class})
public interface FullValidationGroup {}
----

When validating `FullValidationGroup`, first the `Default` group is validated.
If all the data passes validation, then the `ExpensiveValidationGroup` group is validated.
If a constraint is part of both the `Default` and the `ExpensiveValidationGroup` groups, the constraint is validated as part of the `Default` group and will not be validated on the subsequent `ExpensiveValidationGroup` pass.
