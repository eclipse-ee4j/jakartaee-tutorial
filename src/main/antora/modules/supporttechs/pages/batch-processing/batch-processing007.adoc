== Packaging Batch Applications

Job definition files and batch artifacts do not require separate packaging and can be included in any Jakarta EE application.

Package the batch artifact classes with the rest of the classes of your application, and include the job definition files in one of the following directories:

* `META-INF/batch-jobs/` for `jar` packages

* `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/batch-jobs/` for `war` packages

The name of each job definition file must match its job ID.
For example, if you define a job as follows, and you are packaging your application as a WAR file, include the job definition file in `WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/batch-jobs/simplejob.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<job id="simplejob" xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee" 
                    version="2.0">
  ...
</job>
----
