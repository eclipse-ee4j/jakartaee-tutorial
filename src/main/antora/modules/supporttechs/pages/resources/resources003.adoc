== Common Client Interface

This section explains how components use the Jakarta Connectors Common Client Interface (CCI) API and a resource adapter to access data from an EIS.
The CCI API defines a set of interfaces and classes whose methods allow a client to perform typical data access operations.
The CCI interfaces and classes are as follows.

* `ConnectionFactory`: Provides an application component with a `Connection` instance to an EIS.

* `Connection`: Represents the connection to the underlying EIS.

* `ConnectionSpec`: Provides a means for an application component to pass connection-request-specific properties to the `ConnectionFactory` when making a connection request.

* `Interaction`: Provides a means for an application component to execute EIS functions, such as database stored procedures.

* `InteractionSpec`: Holds properties pertaining to an application component's interaction with an EIS.

* `Record`: The superinterface for the various kinds of record instances.
Record instances can be `MappedRecord`, `IndexedRecord`, or `ResultSet` instances, all of which inherit from the `Record` interface.

* `RecordFactory`: Provides an application component with a `Record` instance.

* `IndexedRecord`: Represents an ordered collection of `Record` instances based on the `java.util.List` interface.

A client or application component that uses the CCI to interact with an underlying EIS does so in a prescribed manner.
The component must establish a connection to the EIS's resource manager, and it does so using the `ConnectionFactory`.
The `Connection` object represents the connection to the EIS and is used for subsequent interactions with the EIS.

The component performs its interactions with the EIS, such as accessing data from a specific table, using an `Interaction` object.
The application component defines the Interaction object by using an `InteractionSpec` object.
When it reads data from the EIS, such as from database tables, or writes to those tables, the application component does so by using a particular type of `Record` instance: a `MappedRecord`, an `IndexedRecord`, or a `ResultSet` instance.

Note, too, that a client application that relies on a CCI resource adapter is very much like any other Jakarta EE client that uses enterprise bean methods.
