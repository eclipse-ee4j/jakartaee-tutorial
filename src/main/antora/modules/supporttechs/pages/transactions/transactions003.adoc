== What Is a Transaction?

To emulate a business transaction, a program may need to perform several steps.
A financial program, for example, might transfer funds from a checking account to a savings account by using the steps listed in the following pseudocode:

----
begin transaction
    debit checking account
    credit savings account
    update history log
commit transaction
----

Either all or none of the three steps must complete.
Otherwise, data integrity is lost.
Because the steps within a transaction are a unified whole, a transaction is often defined as an indivisible unit of work.

A transaction can end in two ways: with a commit or with a rollback.
When a transaction commits, the data modifications made by its statements are saved.
If a statement within a transaction fails, the transaction rolls back, undoing the effects of all statements in the transaction.
In the pseudocode, for example, if a disk drive were to crash during the `credit` step, the transaction would roll back and undo the data modifications made by the `debit` statement.
Although the transaction fails, data integrity would be intact because the accounts still balance.

In the preceding pseudocode, the `begin` and `commit` statements mark the boundaries of the transaction.
When designing an enterprise bean, you determine how the boundaries are set by specifying either container-managed or bean-managed transactions.
