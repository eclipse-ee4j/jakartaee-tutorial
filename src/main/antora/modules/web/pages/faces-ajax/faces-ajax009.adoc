== Grouping of Components

The previous sections describe how to associate a single UI component with Ajax functionality.
You can also associate Ajax with more than one component at a time by grouping them together on a page.
The following example shows how a number of components can be grouped by using the `f:ajax` tag:

[source,xml]
----
<f:ajax>
    <h:form>
        <h:inputText id="input1" value="#{user.name}"/> 
        <h:commandButton id="Submit"/>
    </h:form>
</f:ajax>
----

In the example, neither component is associated with any Ajax `event` or `render` attributes yet.
Therefore, no action will take place in case of user input.
You can associate the above components with an `event` and a `render` attribute as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<f:ajax event="click" render="@all">
    <h:form>
        <h:inputText id="input1" value="#{user.name}"/> 
        <h:commandButton id="Submit"/> 
    </h:form>
</f:ajax>
----

In the updated example, when the user clicks either component, the updated results will be displayed for all components.
You can further fine-tune the Ajax action by adding specific events to each of the components, in which case Ajax functionality becomes cumulative.
Consider the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<f:ajax event="click" render="@all">
    ...
    <h:commandButton id="Submit">
        <f:ajax event="mouseover"/>
    </h:commandButton>
    ...
</f:ajax>
----

Now the button component will fire an Ajax action in case of a `mouseover` event as well as a mouse-click event.
