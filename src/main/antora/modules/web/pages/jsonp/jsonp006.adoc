== The jsonpmodel Example Application

This section describes how to build and run the `jsonpmodel` example application.
This example is a web application that demonstrates how to create an object model from form data, how to parse JSON data, and how write JSON data using the object model API.

The `jsonpmodel` example application is in the `_jakartaee-examples_/tutorial/web/jsonp/jsonpmodel` directory.

=== Components of the jsonpmodel Example Application

The `jsonpmodel` example application contains the following files.

* Three Jakarta Faces pages.

** The `index.xhtml` page contains a form to collect information.

** The `modelcreated.xhtml` page contains a text area that displays JSON data.

** The `parsejson.xhtml` page contains a table that shows the elements of the object model.

* The `ObjectModelBean.java` managed bean, which is a session-scoped managed bean that stores the data from the form and directs the navigation between the Facelets pages.
This file also contains code that uses the JSON object model API.

The code used in `ObjectModelBean.java` to create an object model from the data in the form is similar to the example in xref:jsonp/jsonp.adoc#_creating_an_object_model_from_application_code[Creating an Object Model from Application Code].
The code to write JSON output from the model is similar to the example in xref:jsonp/jsonp.adoc#_writing_an_object_model_to_a_stream[Writing an Object Model to a Stream].
The code to navigate the object model tree is similar to the example in xref:jsonp/jsonp.adoc#_navigating_an_object_model[Navigating an Object Model].

=== Running the jsonpmodel Example Application

This section describes how to run the `jsonpmodel` example application using NetBeans IDE and from the command line.

==== To Run the jsonpmodel Example Application Using NetBeans IDE

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see xref:intro:usingexamples/usingexamples.adoc#_starting_and_stopping_glassfish_server[Starting and Stopping GlassFish Server]).

. From the *File* menu, choose *Open Project*.

. In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to: 
+
----
jakartaee-examples/tutorial/web/jsonp
----

. Select the `jsonpmodel` folder.

. Click *Open Project*.

. In the *Projects* tab, right-click the `jsonpmodel` project and select *Run*.
+
This command builds and packages the application into a WAR file (`jsonpmodel.war`) located in the `target` directory, deploys it to the server, and opens a web browser window with the following URL:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/jsonpmodel/
----

. Edit the data on the page and click Create a JSON Object to submit the form.
The following page shows a JSON object that contains the data from the form.

. Click Parse JSON.
The following page contains a table that lists the nodes of the object model tree.

==== To Run the jsonpmodel Example Application Using Maven

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see xref:intro:usingexamples/usingexamples.adoc#_starting_and_stopping_glassfish_server[Starting and Stopping GlassFish Server]).

. In a terminal window, go to: 
+
----
jakartaee-examples/tutorial/web/jsonp/jsonpmodel
----

. Enter the following command to deploy the application: 
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----

. Open a web browser window and enter the following address: 
+
----
http://localhost:8080/jsonpmodel/
