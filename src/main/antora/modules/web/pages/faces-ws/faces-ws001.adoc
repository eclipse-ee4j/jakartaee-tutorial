== About WebSockets in Jakarta Faces

You use the `f:websocket tag` in a view to allow server-side communications to be pushed to all instances of a socket containing the same channel name.
When the communication is received, an `onmessage`, client-side JavaScript event handler can be set that is called whenever a push arrives from the server.

The server side of a WebSocket communication has the ability to push out messages.
You can do this using `jakarta.faces.push.PushContext`, which is an injectable context, allowing a server push to a named channel.
