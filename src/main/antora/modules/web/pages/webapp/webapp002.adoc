== The Web Application Archive

A Jakarta Servlet-based web application can contain one or more of the following parts:

* One or more web components, which can be represented by Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Faces or Jakarta REST.
* Assets (also called static resource files), such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript (JS) and images.
* Dependencies (also called helper libraries, third party libraries, "JARs").
* Deployment descriptor files.

The process for creating, deploying, and executing a Jakarta Servlet-based web application is different from that of Java classes which are packaged and executed as a Java application archive (JAR).
It can be summarized as follows:

. Develop the web component code.
. Develop the deployment descriptor files, if necessary.
. Compile the web component code against the libraries of the servlet container and the helper libraries, if any.
. Package the compiled code along with helper libraries, assets and deployment descriptor files, if any, into a deployable unit, called a web application archive (WAR).
. Deploy the WAR into a servlet container.
. Run the web application by accessing a URL that references the web component.

Developing the web component code and deployment descriptor files is covered in the later chapters.
Steps 3 through 6 are expanded on in the following sections and illustrated with two web applications, in Hello Worldâ€“style.
The web applications take a name as an HTTP request parameter, generate the greeting and return it as an HTTP response.
This chapter discusses the following simple web applications:

* `hello-servlet`, a Jakarta Servlet-based service-oriented web application
* `hello-faces`, a Jakarta Faces-based presentation-oriented web application

They are used to illustrate tasks involved in compiling, packaging, deploying, and running a Jakarta Servlet-based web application that contains web component code.

=== Building, Deploying and Running The Example Projects

This describes steps 3 through 6.
You need Maven and a servlet container.

==== Building The Example Projects

This describes steps 3 and 4.
Maven is used to build the example projects.
Download and install it as per instructions in https://maven.apache.org/[maven.apache.org].
A Maven WAR project has the following basic structure; not all mentioned resources are required, only the `pom.xml` is required and the rest is optional:

[source]
----
 |-- src
 |    `-- main
 |         |-- java
 |         |    `-- com
 |         |         `-- example
 |         |              |-- controller
 |         |              |    `-- Servlet.java
 |         |              `-- model
 |         |                   `-- Bean.java
 |         |-- resources
 |         |    `-- com
 |         |         `-- example
 |         |              `-- i18n
 |         |                   |-- text.properties
 |         |                   |-- text_en.properties
 |         |                   `-- text_es.properties
 |         `-- webapp
 |              |-- META-INF
 |              |    `-- MANIFEST.MF
 |              |-- resources
 |              |    |-- css
 |              |    |    `-- style.css
 |              |    |-- img
 |              |    |    `-- logo.svg
 |              |    `-- js
 |              |         `-- script.js
 |              |-- WEB-INF
 |              |    |-- beans.xml
 |              |    |-- faces-config.xml
 |              |    `-- web.xml
 |              |-- favicon.ico
 |              `-- index.xhtml
 `-- pom.xml
----

In a terminal window, go to the folder containing the `pom.xml` and execute the following command:

[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----

This command compiles and packages the code as described in steps 3 and 4.
After the build, the resulting WAR file will be present in the automatically created `target` folder.
The WAR file is recognizable by having the `.war` extension.

==== Deploying The Example Projects

This describes step 5.
You need at least a servlet container in order to deploy a WAR file.
The https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/[Jakarta EE Compatible Products] page lists several Jakarta runtimes having a servlet container.
At least those compatible with "Web Profile" and "Jakarta EE Platform" have a servlet container.
Examples are Eclipse GlassFish, IBM Open Liberty and Red Hat WildFly.
They are available in both "Web Profile" and "Jakarta EE Platform" flavors.

There are also partial Jakarta runtimes having a servlet container.
Partial as in, they do not fully implement "Web Profile".
One example is Apache Tomcat.
It does implement Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Pages, Jakarta Expression Language, Jakarta WebSocket, and Jakarta Security.
But it does not implement Jakarta REST, Jakarta CDI, Jakarta Faces nor Jakarta Tags.

Deploying a WAR file is generally done by placing the WAR file in the runtime-specific folder dedicated for (automatic) deployments.
The exact location depends on the runtime used:

* In case of Eclipse GlassFish that's the `glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy` folder.
* In case of IBM Open Liberty that's the `config/dropins` folder.
* In case of Red Hat WildFly that's the `standalone/deployments` folder.
* In case of Apache Tomcat that's the `webapps` folder.

Refer to the documentation for your runtime for the most recent information.

Undeploying a WAR file is generally done by removing the WAR file from the folder.

Some runtimes offer a graphical user interface (GUI) for administration tasks such as selecting, uploading and a deploying a WAR file.
For this you'll need to start the server first and then open a specific URL in your web browser representing the location of the admin console:

* In case of Eclipse GlassFish that's reachable via `http://localhost:4848`
* In case of IBM Open Liberty that's reachable via `https://localhost:9443`
* In case of Red Hat WildFly that's reachable via `http://localhost:9990`
* In case of Apache Tomcat that's reachable via `http://localhost:8080/manager`

Refer to the documentation for your runtime for the most recent information.

You can also use an integrated development environment (IDE) to manage runtimes and deployments.
Examples are Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ IDEA and Apache NetBeans.
They can also automatically build the projects for you.

==== Running The Example Projects

This describes step 6.
You'll need to start the server first and then open a specific URL in your web browser representing the location of the WAR deployment.
By default, the URL has the following form:

----
http(s)://host:port/context-path
----

By default, the `context-path` is represented by the base file name of the WAR file, without the extension.
If there is no web component listening on the root of the context path, then you could face an HTTP 404 'Not Found' error page.
In that case you would need to use a more specific URL, depending on the configuration of the desired web component.
This will be detailed in xref:web:webapp/webapp.adoc#_mapping_urls_to_web_components[Mapping URLs to Web Components].
