== Accessing the Web Context

The context in which web components execute is an object that implements the `ServletContext` interface.
You retrieve the web context by using the `getServletContext` method.
The web context provides methods for accessing

* Initialization parameters

* Resources associated with the web context

* Object-valued attributes

* Logging capabilities

The counter's access methods are synchronized to prevent incompatible operations by servlets that are running concurrently.
A filter retrieves the counter object by using the context's `getAttribute` method.
The incremented value of the counter is recorded in the log.
