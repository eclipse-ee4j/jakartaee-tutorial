== Servlet Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a servlet is controlled by the servlet container in which the servlet has been deployed.
When a request is mapped to a servlet, the servlet container performs the following steps:

. If an instance of the servlet does not exist, the servlet container:
.. Loads the servlet class
.. Creates an instance of the servlet class
.. Initializes the servlet instance by calling the `init` method
. The servlet container invokes the `service` method, passing request and response objects.

Initialization is covered in <<creating-and-initializing-a-servlet>>.
Service methods are discussed in <<writing-service-methods>>.

If it needs to remove the servlet, the servlet container finalizes the servlet by calling the servlet's `destroy` method.
For more information, see <<finalizing-a-servlet>>.
