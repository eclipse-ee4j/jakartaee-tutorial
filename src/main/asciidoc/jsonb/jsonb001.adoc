== JSON Binding in the Jakarta EE Platform

Jakarta EE includes support for the Jakarta JSON Binding spec, which provides an API that can serialize Java objects to JSON documents and deserialize JSON documents to Java objects.
Jakarta JSON Binding contains the following packages:

* The `jakarta.json.bind` package contains the binding interface, the builder interface, and a configuration class.
<<main-classes-and-interfaces-in-bind>> lists the main classes and interfaces in this package.

* The `jakarta.json.bind.adapter` package contains the `JsonbAdapter` interface, which provides methods for binding custom Java types by converting them to known types.

* The `jakarta.json.bind.annotation` package defines annotations that can be used to customize default binding behavior.
Annotations can be used for field, JavaBean property, type, or package elements.

* The `jakarta.json.bind.config` package interfaces and classes for customizing default binding behavior.
<<main-classes-and-interfaces-in-config>> lists the main classes and interfaces in this package.

* The `jakarta.json.bind.serializer` package contains interfaces that are used to create serialization and deserialization routines for custom types that cannot be easily mapped using the `JsonbAdapter` methods.
<<main-classes-and-interfaces-in-serializer>> lists the main interfaces in this package.

* The `jakarta.json.bind.spi` package contains a Service Provider Interface (SPI) for creating JSON Binding implementations.
This package contains the `JsonbProvider` class, which contains the methods that a service provider implements.

|Class or Interface |Description

|`Jsonb` | Contains the JSON binding methods for serializing Java objects to JSON and deserailizing JSON to Java objects.

|`JsonBuilder` | Used by clients to create `Jsonb` instances.

|`JsonbConfig` | Used to set configuration properties on `Jsonb` instances.
Properties include binding strategies and properties for configuring custom serializers and deserializers.

|`JsonbException` | Indicates that a problem occurred during JSON binding.

|`PropertyNamingStrategy` | Used to set how property names are translated.

|`PropertyVisibilityStrategy` | Used to set whether fields and methods should be considered properties overriding the default scope and field access behavior.

|`BinaryDataStrategy` | Used to set binary encoding.

|`PropertyOrderStrategy` | Used to set how properties are ordered during serialization.
