= JSON Binding

This chapter describes the Jakarta JSON Binding.
JSON is a data exchange format widely used in web services and other connected applications.
For a brief overview of JSON, see <<introduction-to-json>>.

The https://jakarta.ee/specifications/jsonb/[Jakarta JSON Binding^] specification provides a standard binding layer (metadata and runtime) between Java classes and JSON documents.
One Jakarta JSON Binding reference implementation is Yasson, which is developed through Eclipse.org and is included as part of GlassFish Server.

You can learn more about Yasson at https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.yasson[^].
