== Specifying the Cache Mode Settings to Improve Performance

To adjust the cache mode settings for a persistence unit, specify one of the cache modes as the value of the `shared-cache-mode` element in the `persistence.xml` deployment descriptor (shown in bold):

[source,xml]
----
<persistence-unit name="examplePU" transaction-type="JTA">
    <provider>org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider</provider>
    <jta-data-source>java:comp/DefaultDataSource</jta-data-source>
    <shared-cache-mode>DISABLE_SELECTIVE</shared-cache-mode>
</persistence-unit>
----

[NOTE]
Because support for a second-level cache is not required by the Jakarta Persistence specification, setting the second-level cache mode in `persistence.xml` will have no effect when you use a persistence provider that does not implement a second-level cache.

Alternatively, you can specify the shared cache mode by setting the `jakarta.persistence.sharedCache.mode` property to one of the shared cache mode settings:

[source,java]
----
EntityManagerFactory emf =
    Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(
        "myExamplePU", new Properties().add(
            "jakarta.persistence.sharedCache.mode", "ENABLE_SELECTIVE"));
----

=== Setting the Cache Retrieval and Store Modes

If you have enabled the second-level cache for a persistence unit by setting the shared cache mode, you can further modify the behavior of the second-level cache by setting the `jakarta.persistence.cache.retrieveMode` and `jakarta.persistence.cache.storeMode` properties.
You can set these properties at the persistence context level by passing the property name and value to the `EntityManager.setProperty` method, or you can set them on a per-`EntityManager` operation (`EntityManager.find` or `EntityManager.refresh`) or on a per-query level.

==== Cache Retrieval Mode

The cache retrieval mode, set by the `jakarta.persistence.retrieveMode` property, controls how data is read from the cache for calls to the `EntityManager.find` method and from queries.

You can set the `retrieveMode` property to one of the constants defined by the `jakarta.persistence.CacheRetrieveMode` enumerated type, either `USE` (the default) or `BYPASS`.

When the property is set to `USE`, data is retrieved from the second-level cache, if available.
If the data is not in the cache, the persistence provider will read it from the database.

When the property is set to `BYPASS`, the second-level cache is bypassed and a call to the database is made to retrieve the data.

==== Cache Store Mode

The cache store mode, set by the `jakarta.persistence.storeMode` property, controls how data is stored in the cache.

The `storeMode` property can be set to one of the constants defined by the `jakarta.persistence.CacheStoreMode` enumerated type: either `USE` (the default), `BYPASS`, or `REFRESH`.

When the property is set to `USE`, the cache data is created or updated when data is read from or committed to the database.
If data is already in the cache, setting the store mode to `USE` will not force a refresh when data is read from the database.

When the property is set to `BYPASS`, data read from or committed to the database is not inserted or updated in the cache.
That is, the cache is unchanged.

When the property is set to `REFRESH`, the cache data is created or updated when data is read from or committed to the database, and a refresh is forced on data in the cache upon database reads.

==== Setting the Cache Retrieval or Store Mode

To set the cache retrieval or store mode for the persistence context, call the `EntityManager.setProperty` method with the property name and value pair:

[source,java]
----
EntityManager em = ...;
em.setProperty("jakarta.persistence.cache.storeMode", "BYPASS");
----

To set the cache retrieval or store mode when calling the `EntityManager.find` or `EntityManager.refresh` methods, first create a `Map<String, Object>` instance and add a name/value pair as follows:

[source,java]
----
EntityManager em = ...;
Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<String, Object>();
props.put("jakarta.persistence.cache.retrieveMode", "BYPASS");
String personPK = ...;
Person person = em.find(Person.class, personPK, props);
----

[NOTE]
The cache retrieval mode is ignored when calling the `EntityManager.refresh` method, as calls to `refresh` always result in data being read from the database, not the cache.

To set the retrieval or store mode when using queries, call the `Query.setHint` or `TypedQuery.setHint` methods, depending on the type of query:

[source,java]
----
EntityManager em = ...;
CriteriaQuery<Person> cq = ...;
TypedQuery<Person> q = em.createQuery(cq);
q.setHint("jakarta.persistence.cache.storeMode", "REFRESH");
...
----

Setting the store or retrieve mode in a query or when calling the `EntityManager.find` or `EntityManager.refresh` method overrides the setting of the entity manager.

=== Controlling the Second-Level Cache Programmatically

The `jakarta.persistence.Cache` interface defines methods for interacting with the second-level cache programmatically.

==== Overview of the jakarta.persistence.Cache Interface

The `Cache` interface defines methods to do the following:

* Check whether a particular entity has cached data

* Remove a particular entity from the cache

* Remove all instances (and instances of subclasses) of an entity class from the cache

* Clear the cache of all entity data

[NOTE]
If the second-level cache has been disabled, calls to the `Cache` interface's methods have no effect, except for `contains`, which will always return `false`.

==== Checking whether an Entity's Data Is Cached

To find out whether a given entity is currently in the second-level cache:

. Call the `Cache.contains` method .
The `contains` method returns `true` if the entity's data is cached, and `false` if the data is not in the cache:
+
[source,java]
----
EntityManager em = ...;
Cache cache = em.getEntityManagerFactory().getCache();
String personPK = ...;
if (cache.contains(Person.class, personPK)) {
  // the data is cached
} else {
  // the data is NOT cached
}
----

==== Removing an Entity from the Cache

To remove a particular entity or all entities of a given type from the second-level cache:

. Call one of the `Cache.evict` methods.

.. To remove a particular entity from the cache, call the `evict` method and pass in the entity class and the primary key of the entity:
+
[source,java]
----
EntityManager em = ...;
Cache cache = em.getEntityManagerFactory().getCache();
String personPK = ...;
cache.evict(Person.class, personPK);
----

.. To remove all instances of a particular entity class, including subclasses, call the `evict` method and specify the entity class:
+
[source,java]
----
EntityManager em = ...;
Cache cache = em.getEntityManagerFactory().getCache();
cache.evict(Person.class);
----

All instances of the `Person` entity class will be removed from the cache.
If the `Person` entity has a subclass, `Student`, calls to the above method will remove all instances of `Student` from the cache as well.

==== Removing All Data from the Cache

To completely clear the second-level cache, call the `Cache.evictAll` method:

[source,java]
----
EntityManager em = ...;
Cache cache = em.getEntityManagerFactory().getCache();
cache.evictAll();
----
