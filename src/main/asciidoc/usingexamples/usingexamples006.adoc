== Tutorial Example Directory Structure

To facilitate iterative development and keep application source files separate from compiled files, the tutorial examples use the Maven application directory structure.

Each application module has the following structure:

* `pom.xml`: Maven build file

* `src/main/java`: Java source files for the module

* `src/main/resources`: configuration files for the module, with the exception of web applications

* `src/main/webapp`: web pages, style sheets, tag files, and images (web applications only)

* `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF`: configuration files for web applications (web applications only)

When an example has multiple application modules packaged into an EAR file, its submodule directories use the following naming conventions:

* _example-name_``-app-client``: application clients

* _example-name_``-ejb``: enterprise bean JAR files

* _example-name_``-war``: web applications

* _example-name_``-ear``: enterprise applications

* _example-name_``-common``: library JAR containing components, classes, and files used by other modules

The Maven build files (`pom.xml`) distributed with the examples contain goals to compile and assemble the application into the `target` directory and deploy the archive to GlassFish Server.
