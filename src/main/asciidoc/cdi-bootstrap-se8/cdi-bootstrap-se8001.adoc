== The Bootstrap API

The API for bootstrapping a CDI container in Java SE consists of the following entities:

* `jakarta.enterprise.inject.se.SeContainerInitializer` class – Allows you to configure and bootstrap the CDI container. This class includes the following key methods:

** `newInstance()` obtains a `SeContainerInitializer` instance, which allows you to configure the container prior to bootstrapping it.

** `initialize()` bootstraps the container. 

* `jakarta.enterprise.inject.se.SeContainer` interface – Provides access to the `BeanManager` instance for programmatic lookup, as defined in the `SeContainer` interface, which is described at https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/3.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-3.0.html#se_container[^].
