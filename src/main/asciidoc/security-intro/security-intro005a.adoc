== Working with Identity Stores

An identity store is a database or directory (store) that contains identity information about a collection of users that includes an application's callers.
An identity store holds callers names, group membership information, and information sufficient to allow it to validate a caller's credentials.
An identity store may also contain other information, such as globally unique caller identifiers or other caller attributes.

As specified in the Jakarta EE Security API, the `IdentityStore` interface provides an abstraction of an identity store.
Implementations of the `IdentityStore` interface interact with identity stores to authenticate users and to retrieve caller group information.
Most often, an implementation of the `IdentityStore` interface interacts with an external identity store, such as an LDAP server, but it can also manage user account data itself.

The `IdentityStore` interface is intended primarily for use by the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` (also specified in the Jakarta Security), but can be used by other implementations such as a JASPIC `ServerAuthModule` or a container's built-in authentication mechanisms.
Using the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` and `IdentityStore` implementations, both built-in and custom, provides a significant advantage over the BASIC and FORM mechanisms defined by Servlet 5.0 (and previous versions) and configured declaratively using `<login-config>` in `web.xml`, because it allows an application to control the identity stores it will authenticate against in a standard, portable way.

An application can provide its own `IdentityStore`, or use the built in LDAP or Database identity store implementations of the interface.
