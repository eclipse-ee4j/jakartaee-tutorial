== Securing GlassFish Server

This tutorial describes deployment to GlassFish Server, which provides highly secure, interoperable, and distributed component computing based on the Jakarta EE security model.
GlassFish Server supports the Jakarta EE 9 security model.
You can configure GlassFish Server for the following purposes.

* Adding, deleting, or modifying authorized users.
For more information on this topic, see <<working-with-realms-users-groups-and-roles>>.

* Configuring secure HTTP and Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) listeners.

* Configuring secure Java Management Extensions (JMX) connectors.

* Adding, deleting, or modifying existing or custom realms.

* Defining an interface for pluggable authorization providers using Jakarta Authorization.
Jakarta Authorization defines security contracts between GlassFish Server and authorization policy modules.
These contracts specify how the authorization providers are installed, configured, and used in access decisions.

* Using pluggable audit modules.

* Customizing authentication mechanisms.
All implementations of Jakarta EE 9 compatible web containers are required to support the Servlet Profile of Jakarta Authentication, which offers an avenue for customizing the authentication mechanism applied by the web container on behalf of one or more applications.

* Setting and changing policy permissions for an application.
