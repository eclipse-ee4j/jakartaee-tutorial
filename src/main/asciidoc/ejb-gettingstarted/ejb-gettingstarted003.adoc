== Modifying the Jakarta EE Application

GlassFish Server supports iterative development.
Whenever you make a change to a Jakarta EE application, you must redeploy the application.

=== To Modify a Class File

To modify a class file in an enterprise bean, you change the source code, recompile it, and redeploy the application.
For example, to update the exchange rate in the `dollarToYen` business method of the `ConverterBean` class, you would follow these steps.

To modify `ConverterServlet`, the procedure is the same.

. Edit `ConverterBean.java` and save the file.

. Recompile the source file.

.. To recompile `ConverterBean.java` in NetBeans IDE, right-click the `converter` project and select Run.
+
This recompiles the `ConverterBean.java` file, replaces the old class file in the build directory, and redeploys the application to GlassFish Server.

.. Recompile `ConverterBean.java` using Maven.

... In a terminal window, go to the `_tut-install_/examples/ejb/converter/` directory.

...  Enter the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----
+
This command repackages and deploys the application.
