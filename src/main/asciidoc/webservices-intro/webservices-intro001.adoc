== What Are Web Services?

Web services are client and server applications that communicate over the World Wide Web's (WWW) HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
As described by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), web services provide a standard means of interoperating between software applications running on a variety of platforms and frameworks.
Web services are characterized by their great interoperability and extensibility as well as their machine-processable descriptions, thanks to the use of XML.
Web services can be combined in a loosely coupled way to achieve complex operations.
Programs providing simple services can interact with each other to deliver sophisticated added-value services.
