== Deciding Which Type of Web Service to Use

Basically, you want to use RESTful web services for integration over the web and big web services in enterprise applicationâ€“integration scenarios that have advanced quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.

Jakarta XML Web Services:: Addresses advanced QoS requirements that commonly occur in enterprise computing.
When compared to Jakarta RESTful Web Services, XML Web Services makes it easier to support the WS-* set of protocols, which provide standards for security and reliability, among other things, and interoperate with other WS-* conforming clients and servers.

Jakarta RESTful Web Services:: Makes it easier to write web applications that apply some or all of the constraints of the REST style to induce desirable properties in the application, such as loose coupling (evolving the server is easier without breaking existing clients), scalability (start small and grow), and architectural simplicity (use off-the-shelf components, such as proxies or HTTP routers).
You would choose to use Jakarta RESTful Web Services for your web application because it is easier for many types of clients to consume RESTful web services while enabling the server side to evolve and scale.
Clients can choose to consume some or all aspects of the service and mash it up with other web-based services.
