== About Jakarta Security

Jakarta EE includes support for Jakarta Security, which defines portable, plug-in interfaces for authentication and identity stores, and a new injectable-type SecurityContext interface that provides an access point for programmatic security.
You can use the built-in implementations of these APIs, or define custom implementations.

Jakarta Security contains the following packages:

* The `jakarta.security.enterprise` package is the main Jakarta Security package and contains classes and interfaces that span authentication, authorization, and identity concerns.
<<main-classes-and-interfaces-in-enterprise>> lists the main class and interfaces in this package.

* The `jakarta.security.enterprise.authentication.mechanism.http` package contains classes and interfaces associated with HTTP-based authentication mechanisms that can interact with a caller or third-parties as part of an authentication protocol.
<<main-classes-and-interfaces-in-authentication>> lists the main classes and interfaces in this package.

* The `jakarta.security.enterprise.credential` package contains classes and interfaces for representing user credentials.
<<main-classes-and-interfaces-in-credential>> lists the main classes and interfaces in this package.

* The `jakarta.security.enterprise.identitystore` package contains classes and interfaces associated with identity stores that validate a caller's credentials and lookup caller groups.
<<main-classes-and-interfaces-in-identitystore>> lists the main classes and interfaces in this package.

[width="99%",cols="25%,75%"]
|===
|Class or Interface |Description

|`SecurityContext` |Injectable-type interface that provides an access point for programmatic security intended to be used by application code to query and interact with the Jakarta Security.

|`CallerPrincipal` |Principal type that can represent the identity of the application caller.

|`AuthenticationStatus` |Enum used to indicate the return value from an authentication mechanism.

|`AuthenticationException` |Indicates that a problem occurred during the authentication process.

.Main Classes and Interfaces in `jakarta.security.enterprise.authentication.mechanism.http`
[width="99%",cols="25%,75%"]
|===
|Class or Interface |Description

|`HttpAuthenticationMechanism` |Interface representing an HTTP authentication mechanism.
Developers can provide their own implementation of this interface, or use one of several built-in HTTP authentication mechanisms.

|`HttpMessageContext` |Interface representing the parameters passed to/from methods of an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` at runtime.

|`AuthenticationParameters` |Class that carries parameters passed to the `SecurityContext.authenticate()` method.

|`HttpMessageContextWrapper` |Abstract class developers can extend to customize `HttpMessageContext` behavior.
|===

[NOTE]
The `jakarta.security.enterprise.authentication.mechanism.http` package also includes a number of annotation classes that are used to configure/enable the built-in authentication mechanisms or to modify the behavior of an authentication mechanism.

[[main-classes-and-interfaces-in-credential]]
.Main Classes and Interfaces in `jakarta.security.enterprise.credential`
[width="99%",cols="25%,75%"]
|===
|Class or Interface |Description

|`Credential` |Interface that represents a generic credential and defines several methods to operate on credentials.
All other classes in this package are implementations of the Credential interface.

|`AbstractClearableCredential` |Abstract class implementing behavior common to Credentials that can be meaningfully cleared.

|`BasicAuthenticationCredential` |Class that extends `UsernamePasswordCredential` to represent credentials used by HTTP Basic Authentication.

|`CallerOnlyCredential` |Credential that contains a caller name only; can be used to assert an identity, but not to authenticate a user, due to the lack of any secret or other credential that can be validated.

|`Password` |Class that represents a text-based password.

|`RememberMeCredential` |Class that represents a credential presented as a token, for the explicit usage with the Jakarta Security remember me function.

|`UsernamePasswordCredential` |Class that represents the credentials typically used by standard caller name/password authentication.

[[main-classes-and-interfaces-in-identitystore]]
.Main Classes and Interfaces in `jakarta.security.enterprise.identitystore`
[width="99%",cols="25%,75%"]
|===
|Class or Interface |Description

|`IdentityStore` |Interface representing an Identity Store.
Developers can provide their own implementation of this interface, or use one of the built-in Identity Stores.

|`IdentityStoreHandler` |Interface that defines the method applications use to interact with Identity Stores.
Applications can use the built-in IdentityStoreHandler, or supply their own implementation if custom behavior is desired.

|`PasswordHash` |Interface defining methods for generating and validating password hashes, needed to securely validate passwords when using the built-in Database Identity Store.
Developers can implement this interface to generate/validate password hashes using any desired algorithm.

|`Pbkdf2PasswordHash` |Marker interface implemented by the built-in PBKDF2 PasswordHash implementation.
Developers can use this interface to select the built-in PBKDF2 algorithm when configuring the Database Identity Store.

|`RememberMeIdentityStore` |Interface defining a special type of Identity Store, used in conjunction with the RememberMe annotation to provide RememberMe behavior for an application.

|`CredentialValidationResult` |Class that represents the result from an attempt to validate a Credential.

|`IdentityStorePermission` |Permission required to invoke the `getGroups` method of an IdentityStore, when a SecurityManager is configured.
