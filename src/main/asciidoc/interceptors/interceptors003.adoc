== The interceptor Example Application

The `interceptor` example demonstrates how to use an interceptor class, containing an `@AroundInvoke` interceptor method, with a stateless session bean.

The `HelloBean` stateless session bean is a simple enterprise bean with two business methods, `getName` and `setName`, to retrieve and modify a string.
The `setName` business method has an `@Interceptors` annotation that specifies an interceptor class, `HelloInterceptor`, for that method:

[source,java]
----
@Interceptors(HelloInterceptor.class)
public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
----

The `HelloInterceptor` class defines an `@AroundInvoke` interceptor method, `modifyGreeting`, that converts the string passed to `HelloBean.setName` to lowercase:

[source,java]
----
@AroundInvoke
public Object modifyGreeting(InvocationContext ctx) throws Exception {
    Object[] parameters = ctx.getParameters();
    String param = (String) parameters[0];
    param = param.toLowerCase();
    parameters[0] = param;
    ctx.setParameters(parameters);
    try {
        return ctx.proceed();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        logger.warning("Error calling ctx.proceed in modifyGreeting()");
        return null;
    }
}
----

The parameters to `HelloBean.setName` are retrieved and stored in an `Object` array by calling the `InvocationContext.getParameters` method.
Because `setName` only has one parameter, it is the first and only element in the array.
The string is set to lowercase and stored in the `parameters` array, then passed to `InvocationContext.setParameters`.
To return control to the session bean, `InvocationContext.proceed` is called.

The user interface of `interceptor` is a JavaServer Faces web application that consists of two Facelets views: `index.xhtml`, which contains a form for entering the name, and `response.xhtml`, which displays the final name.

=== Running the interceptor Example

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, package, deploy, and run the `interceptor` example.

==== To Run the interceptor Example Using NetBeans IDE

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. From the File menu, choose Open Project.

. In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/ejb
----

. Select the `interceptor` folder and click Open Project.

. In the Projects tab, right-click the `interceptor` project and select Run.
+
This will compile, deploy, and run the `interceptor` example, opening a web browser to the following URL:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/interceptor/
----

. Enter a name into the form and click Submit.
+
The name will be converted to lowercase by the method interceptor defined in the `HelloInterceptor` class.

==== To Run the interceptor Example Using Maven

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. Go to the following directory:
+
----
tut-install/examples/ejb/interceptor/
----

. To compile the source files and package the application, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----
+
This command builds and packages the application into a WAR file, `interceptor.war`, located in the `target` directory.
The WAR file is then deployed to GlassFish Server.

. Open the following URL in a web browser:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/interceptor/
----

. Enter a name into the form and click Submit.
+
The name will be converted to lowercase by the method interceptor defined in the `HelloInterceptor` class.
