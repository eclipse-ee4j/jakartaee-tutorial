== Setting Up a Page

A typical Jakarta Faces web page includes the following elements:

* A set of namespace declarations that declare the Jakarta Faces tag libraries

* Optionally, the HTML head (`h:head`) and body (`h:body`) tags

* A form tag (`h:form`) that represents the user input components

To add the Jakarta Faces components to your web page, you need to provide the page access to the two standard tag libraries: the Jakarta Faces HTML render kit tag library and the Jakarta Faces core tag library.
The https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/3.0/renderkitdoc/[Jakarta Faces standard HTML tag library^] defines tags that represent common HTML user interface components.
The Jakarta Faces core tag library defines tags that perform core actions and are independent of a particular render kit.

For a complete list of Jakarta Faces Facelets tags and their attributes, refer to the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/3.0/vdldoc/[Jakarta Faces Facelets Tag Library documentation^].

To use any of the Jakarta Faces tags, you need to include appropriate directives at the top of each page specifying the tag libraries.

For Facelets applications, the XML namespace directives uniquely identify the tag library URI and the tag prefix.

For example, when you create a Facelets XHTML page, include namespace directives as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
      xmlns:h="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html"
      xmlns:f="http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core">
----

The XML namespace URI identifies the tag library location, and the prefix value is used to distinguish the tags belonging to that specific tag library.
You can also use other prefixes instead of the standard `h` or `f`.
However, when including the tag in the page you must use the prefix that you have chosen for the tag library.
For example, in the following web page the `form` tag must be referenced using the `h` prefix because the preceding tag library directive uses the `h` prefix to distinguish the tags defined in the HTML tag library:

[source,xml]
----
<h:form ...>
----

The sections <<adding-components-to-a-page-using-html-tag-library-tags>> and <<using-core-tags>> describe how to use the component tags from the Jakarta Faces standard HTML tag library and the core tags from the Jakarta Faces core tag library.
