= Using Jakarta Faces Technology in Web Pages

Web pages (Facelets pages, in most cases) represent the presentation layer for web applications.
The process of creating web pages for a Jakarta Faces application includes using component tags to add components to the page and wire them to backing beans, validators, listeners, converters, and other server-side objects that are associated with the page.

This chapter explains how to create web pages using various types of component and core tags.
In the next chapter, you will learn about adding converters, validators, and listeners to component tags to provide additional functionality to components.

Many of the examples in this chapter are taken from xref:dukes-bookstore-case-study-example[xrefstyle=full]
