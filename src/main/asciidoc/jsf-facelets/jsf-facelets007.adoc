== Relocatable Resources

You can place a resource tag in one part of a page and specify that it be rendered in another part of the page.
To do this, you use the `target` attribute of a tag that specifies a resource.
Acceptable values for this attribute are as follows.

* "`head`" renders the resource in the `head` element.

* "`body`" renders the resource in the `body` element.

* "`form`" renders the resource in the `form` element.

For example, the following `h:outputScript` tag is placed within an `h:form` element, but it renders the JavaScript in the `head` element:

[source,xml]
----
<h:form>
    <h:outputScript name="myscript.js" library="mylibrary" target="head"/>
</h:form>
----

The `h:outputStylesheet` tag also supports resource relocation, in a similar way.

Relocatable resources are essential for composite components that use stylesheets and can also be useful for composite components that use JavaScript.
See <<the-compositecomponentexample-example-application>> for an example.
