== Resource Library Contracts

Resource library contracts allow you to define a different look and feel for different parts of one or more applications, instead of either having to use the same look and feel for all or having to specify a different look on a page-by-page basis.

To do this, you create a `contracts` section of your web application.
Within the `contracts` section, you can specify any number of named areas, each of which is called a contract.
Within each contract you can specify resources such as template files, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images.

For example, you could specify two contracts named `c1` and `c2`, each of which uses a template and other files:

----
src/main/webapp
    WEB-INF/
    contracts
        c1
            template.xhtml
            style.css
            myImg.gif
            myJS.js
        c2
            template.xhtml
            style2.css
            img2.gif
            JS2.js
    index.xhtml
    ...
----

One part of the application can use `c1`, while another can use `c2`.

Another way to use contracts is to specify a single contract that contains multiple templates:

----
src/main/webapp
    contracts
        myContract
            template1.xhtml
            template2.xhtml
            style.css
            img.png
            img2.png
----

You can package a resource library contract in a JAR file for reuse in different applications.
If you do so, the contracts must be located under `META-INF/contracts`.
You can then place the JAR file in the `WEB-INF/lib` directory of an application.
This means that the application would be organized as follows:

----
src/main/webapp/
    WEB-INF/lib/myContract.jar
    ...
----

You can specify the contract usage within an application's `faces-config.xml` file, under the `resource-library-contracts` element.
You need to use this element only if your application uses more than one contract, however.

=== The hello1-rlc Example Application

The `hello1-rlc` example modifies the simple `hello1` example from <<a-web-module-that-uses-jakarta-faces-technology-the-hello1-example>> to use two resource library contracts.
Each of the two pages in the application uses a different contract.

The managed bean for `hello1-rlc`, `Hello.java`, is identical to the one for `hello1` (except that it replaces the `@Named` and `@RequestScoped` annotations with `@Model`).

The source code for this application is in the `_tut-install_/examples/web/jsf/hello1-rlc/` directory.

==== Configuring the hello1-rlc Example

The `faces-config.xml` file for the `hello1-rlc` example contains the following elements:

[source,xml]
----
<resource-library-contracts>
    <contract-mapping>
        <url-pattern>/reply/*</url-pattern>
        <contracts>reply</contracts>
    </contract-mapping>
    <contract-mapping>
        <url-pattern>*</url-pattern>
        <contracts>hello</contracts>
    </contract-mapping>
</resource-library-contracts>
----

The `contract-mapping` elements within the `resource-library-contracts` element map each contract to a different set of pages within the application.
One contract, named `reply`, is used for all pages under the `reply` area of the application (`/reply/\*`).
The other contract, `hello`, is used for all other pages in the application (`*`).

The application is organized as follows:

----
hello1-rlc
    pom.xml
    src/main/java/ee/jakarta/tutorial/hello1rlc/Hello.java
    src/main/webapp
        WEB-INF
            faces-config.xml
            web.xml
        contracts
            hello
                default.css
                duke.handsOnHips.gif
                template.xhtml
            reply
                default.css
                duke.thumbsup.gif
                template.xhtml
        reply
            response.xhtml
        greeting.xhtml
----

The `web.xml` file specifies the `welcome-file` as `greeting.xhtml`.
Because it is not located under `src/main/webapp/reply`, this Facelets page uses the `hello` contract, whereas `src/main/webapp/reply/response.xhtml` uses the `reply` contract.

==== The Facelets Pages for the hello1-rlc Example

The `greeting.xhtml` and `response.xhtml` pages have identical code calling in their templates:

[source,xml]
----
<ui:composition template="/template.xhtml">
----

The `template.xhtml` files in the `hello` and `reply` contracts differ only in two respects: the placeholder text for the `title` element ("Hello Template" and "Reply Template") and the graphic that each specifies.

The `default.css` stylesheets in the two contracts differ in only one respect: the background color specified for the `body` element.

==== To Build, Package, and Deploy the hello1-rlc Example Using NetBeans IDE

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. From the *File* menu, choose *Open Project*.

. In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/web/jsf
----

. Select the `hello1-rlc` folder.

. Click *Open Project*.

. In the *Projects* tab, right-click the `hello1-rlc` project and select *Build*.
+
This option builds the example application and deploys it to your GlassFish Server instance.

==== To Build, Package, and Deploy the hello1-rlc Example Using Maven

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. In a terminal window, go to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/web/jsf/hello1-rlc/
----

. Enter the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----
+
This command builds and packages the application into a WAR file, `hello1-rlc.war`, that is located in the `target` directory.
It then deploys it to your GlassFish Server instance.

==== To Run the hello1-rlc Example

. Enter the following URL in your web browser:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/hello1-rlc
----

. The `greeting.xhtml` page looks just like the one from `hello1` except for its background color and graphic.

. In the text field, enter your name and click Submit.

. The response page also looks just like the one from `hello1` except for its background color and graphic.
+
The page displays the name you submitted.
Click Back to return to the `greeting.xhtml` page.
