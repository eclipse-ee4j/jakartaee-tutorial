== The Lifecycle of a Facelets Application

The Jakarta Faces specification defines the lifecycle of a Jakarta Faces application.
For more information on this lifecycle, see <<the-lifecycle-of-a-jakarta-faces-application>>.
The following steps describe that process as applied to a Facelets-based application.

. When a client, such as a browser, makes a new request to a page that is created using Facelets, a new component tree or `jakarta.faces.component.UIViewRoot` is created and placed in the `FacesContext`.

. [[step-2-of-lifecycle-of-facelets, Step 2]] The `UIViewRoot` is applied to the Facelets, and the view is populated with components for rendering.

. The newly built view is rendered back as a response to the client.

. On rendering, the state of this view is stored for the next request.
The state of input components and form data is stored.

. The client may interact with the view and request another view or change from the Jakarta Faces application.
At this time, the saved view is restored from the stored state.

. The restored view is once again passed through the Jakarta Faces lifecycle, which eventually will either generate a new view or re-render the current view if there were no validation problems and no action was triggered.

. If the same view is requested, the stored view is rendered once again.

. If a new view is requested, then the process described in <<step-2-of-lifecycle-of-facelets>> is continued.

. The new view is then rendered back as a response to the client.
