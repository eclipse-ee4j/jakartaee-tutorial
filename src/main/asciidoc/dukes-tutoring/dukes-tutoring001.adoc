== Design and Architecture of Duke's Tutoring

Duke's Tutoring is a web application that incorporates several Jakarta EE technologies.
It exposes both a main interface (for students, guardians, and tutoring center staff) and an administration interface (for staff to maintain the system).
The business logic for both interfaces is provided by enterprise beans.
The enterprise beans use the Jakarta Persistence to create and store the application's data in the database.
<<architecture-of-the-dukes-tutoring-example-application>> illustrates the architecture of the application.

These interfaces communicate with enterprise beans deployed in the Jakarta Enterprise Beans container. The enterprise beans communicate with the database."]

The Duke's Tutoring application is organized into two main projects: the `dukes-tutoring-common` library and the `dukes-tutoring-war` web application.
The `dukes-tutoring-common` library project contains the entity classes and helper classes used by the `dukes-tutoring-war` web application, and `dukes-tutoring-common` is packaged and deployed with `dukes-tutoring-war`.
The library JAR file is useful for allowing the entity classes and helper classes to be reused by other applications, such as a JavaFX client application.

Duke's Tutoring uses the following Jakarta EE platform features:

* Jakarta Persistence entities

** A custom Jakarta Bean Validation annotation, `@Email`, for validating email addresses

** A standard `jta-data-source` definition that will create the JDBC resource on deployment

** A standard property in the `persistence.xml` deployment descriptor to automatically and portably create and delete the tables in the `jta-data-source`

* Enterprise beans

** Local, no-interface view session and singleton beans

** Jakarta RESTful Web Services resources in a session bean

** Jakarta EE security constraints on the administrative interface business methods

** All enterprise beans packaged within the WAR

* WebSocket

** A WebSocket server endpoint that automatically publishes the status of students to client endpoints

* Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection

** A CDI event that is fired when the status of a student changes

** Handler methods for updating the application once the status event is fired

** CDI managed beans for Facelets pages

** Bean Validation annotations in the CDI managed beans

* Jakarta Faces technology, using Facelets for the web front end

** Templating

** Composite components

** A custom formatter, `PhoneNumberFormatter`

** Security constraints on the administrative interface

** Ajax-enabled Facelets components

The Duke's Tutoring application has two main user interfaces, both packaged within a single WAR file:

* The main interface, for students, guardians, and staff

* The administrative interface used by the staff to manage the students and guardians, and to generate attendance reports
