== Design and Architecture of Duke's Bookstore

Duke's Bookstore is a simple web application that uses many features of Jakarta Faces technology, in addition to other Jakarta EE features:

* Jakarta Faces technology, as well as Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI)

** A set of Facelets pages, along with a template, provides the user interface to the application.

** CDI managed beans are associated with each of the Facelets pages.

** A custom image map component on the front page allows you to select a book to enter the store.
Each area of the map is represented by a Jakarta Faces managed bean.
Text hyperlinks are also provided for accessibility.

** Action listeners are registered on the image map and the text links.
These listeners retrieve the ID value for the selected book and store it in the session map so it can be retrieved by the managed bean for the next page.

** The `h:dataTable` tag is used to render the book catalog and shopping cart contents dynamically.

** A custom converter is registered on the credit card field on the checkout page, `bookcashier.xhtml`, which also uses an `f:validateRegEx` tag to ensure that the input is correctly formatted.

** A value-change listener is registered on the name field on `bookcashier.xhtml`.
This listener saves the name in a parameter so the following page, `bookreceipt.xhtml`, can access it.

* Enterprise beans: Local, no-interface-view stateless session bean and singleton bean

* A Jakarta Persistence entity
