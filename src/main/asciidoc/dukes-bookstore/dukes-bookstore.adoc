--------------------------------------


The Duke's Bookstore example is a simple e-commerce application that
illustrates some of the more advanced features of Jakarta Server Faces
technology in combination with Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 
(CDI), enterprise beans, and the Jakarta Persistence. Users can
select books from an image map, view the bookstore catalog, and purchase
books. No security is used in this application.
