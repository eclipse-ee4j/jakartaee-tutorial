== Running the Duke's Bookstore Case Study Application

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, package, deploy, and run the Duke's Bookstore application.

=== To Build and Deploy Duke's Bookstore Using NetBeans IDE

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. From the File menu, choose Open Project.

. In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/case-studies
----

. Select the `dukes-bookstore` folder.

. Click Open Project.

. In the Projects tab, right-click the `dukes-bookstore` project and select Build.

This will build, package, and deploy Duke's Bookstore to GlassFish Server.

=== To Build and Deploy Duke's Bookstore Using Maven

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>), as well as the database server (see <<starting-and-stopping-apache-derby>>).

. In a terminal window, go to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/case-studies/dukes-bookstore/
----

. Enter the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install

This command builds the application and packages it in a WAR file in the `_tut-install_/examples/case-studies/dukes-bookstore/target/` directory.
It then deploys the application to GlassFish Server.
