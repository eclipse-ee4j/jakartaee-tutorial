= Packaging

This chapter describes packaging. A Jakarta EE application is packaged into
one or more standard units for deployment to any Jakarta EE
platform-compliant system. Each unit contains a functional component or
components, such as an enterprise bean, web page, servlet, or applet,
and an optional deployment descriptor that describes its content.
