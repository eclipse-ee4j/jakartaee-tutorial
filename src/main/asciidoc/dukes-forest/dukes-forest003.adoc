This task configures the server, creates and populates the database, builds all the subprojects, assembles them into JAR and WAR files, and deploys the `dukes-payment`, `dukes-store,` and `dukes-shipment` applications.
+
To configure the server, this task creates a JDBC security realm named `jdbcRealm`, enables default principal-to-role mapping, and enables single sign-on (SSO) for the HTTP Service.
