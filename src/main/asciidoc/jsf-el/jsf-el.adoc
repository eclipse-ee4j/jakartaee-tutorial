= Expression Language

This chapter introduces the Expression Language (also referred to as
the EL), which provides an important mechanism for enabling the
presentation layer (web pages) to communicate with the application
logic (managed beans). The EL is used by several Jakarta EE
technologies, such as Jakarta Faces technology, Jakarta Server Pages
technology, and Dependency Injection for Jakarta EE (CDI). The EL can
also be used in stand-alone environments. This chapter only covers the
use of the EL in Jakarta EE containers.
