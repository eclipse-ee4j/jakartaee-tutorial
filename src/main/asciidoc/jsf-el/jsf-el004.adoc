== Operations on Collection Objects

The EL supports operations on collection objects: sets, lists, and maps.
It allows the dynamic creation of collection objects, which can then be operated on using streams and pipelines.

[NOTE]
Like lambda expressions, operations on collection objects are part of Java SE 8.

For example, you can construct a set as follows:

[source,java]
----
{1,2,3}
----

You can construct a list as follows; a list can contain various types of items:

[source,java]
----
[1,2,3]
[1, "two", [three,four]]
----

You can construct a map by using a colon to define the entries, as follows:

[source,java]
----
{"one":1, "two":2, "three":3}
----

You operate on collection objects using method calls to the stream of elements derived from the collection.
Some operations return another stream, which allows additional operations.
Therefore, you can chain these operations together in a pipeline.

A stream pipeline consists of the following:

* A source (the `Stream` object)

* Any number of intermediate operations that return a stream (for example, `filter` and `map`)

* A terminal operation that does not return a stream (for example, `toList()`)

The `stream` method obtains a `Stream` from a `java.util.Collection` or a Java array.
The stream operations do not modify the original collection object.

For example, you might generate a list of titles of history books as follows:

[source,java]
----
books.stream().filter(b->b.category == "history")
              .map(b->b.title)
              .toList()
----

The following simpler example returns a sorted version of the original list:

[source,java]
----
[1,3,5,2].stream().sorted().toList()
----

Streams and stream operations are documented in the Java SE 8 API documentation, available at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/[^].
The following subset of operations is supported by the EL:

[options="noheader",width="50%"]
|===
|`allMatch` |`anyMatch` |`average` |`count`

|`distinct` |`filter` |`findFirst` |`flatMap`

|`forEach` |`iterator` |`limit` |`map`

|`max` |`min` |`noneMatch` |`peek`

|`reduce` |`sorted` |`substream` |`sum` 

|`toArray` 3+|`toList`
|===

See the Expression Language specification at https://jakarta.ee/specifications/expression-language/4.0/[^] for details on these operations.
