== Packaging CDI Applications

When you deploy a Jakarta EE application, CDI looks for beans inside bean archives.
A bean archive is any module that contains beans that the CDI runtime can manage and inject.
There are two kinds of bean archives: explicit bean archives and implicit bean archives.

An explicit bean archive is an archive that contains a `beans.xml` deployment descriptor, which can be an empty file, contain no version number, or contain the version number 3.0 with the `bean-discovery-mode` attribute set to `all`.
For example:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee
                           https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/beans_3_0.xsd"
       version="3.0" bean-discovery-mode="all">
    ...
</beans>
----

CDI can manage and inject any bean in an explicit archive, except those annotated with `@Vetoed`.

An implicit bean archive is an archive that contains some beans annotated with a scope type, contains no `beans.xml` deployment descriptor, or contains a `beans.xml` deployment descriptor with the `bean-discovery-mode` attribute set to `annotated`.

In an implicit archive, CDI can only manage and inject beans annotated with a scope type.

For a web application, the `beans.xml` deployment descriptor, if present, must be in the `WEB-INF` directory.
For enterprise bean modules or JAR files, the `beans.xml` deployment descriptor, if present, must be in the `META-INF` directory.
