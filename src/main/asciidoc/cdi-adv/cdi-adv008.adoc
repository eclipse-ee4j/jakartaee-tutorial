== Using Stereotypes in CDI Applications

A stereotype is a kind of annotation, applied to a bean, that incorporates other annotations.
Stereotypes can be particularly useful in large applications in which you have a number of beans that perform similar functions.
A stereotype is a kind of annotation that specifies the following:

* A default scope

* Zero or more interceptor bindings

* Optionally, a `@Named` annotation, guaranteeing default EL naming

* Optionally, an `@Alternative` annotation, specifying that all beans with this stereotype are alternatives

A bean annotated with a particular stereotype will always use the specified annotations, so you do not have to apply the same annotations to many beans.

For example, you might create a stereotype named `Action`, using the `jakarta.enterprise.inject.Stereotype` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@RequestScoped
@Secure
@Transactional
@Named
@Stereotype
@Target(TYPE)
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Action {}
----

All beans annotated `@Action` will have request scope, use default EL naming, and have the interceptor bindings `@Transactional` and `@Secure`.

You could also create a stereotype named `Mock`:

[source,java]
----
@Alternative
@Stereotype
@Target(TYPE)
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Mock {}
----

All beans with this annotation are alternatives.

It is possible to apply multiple stereotypes to the same bean, so you can annotate a bean as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Action
@Mock
public class MockLoginAction extends LoginAction { ... }
----

It is also possible to override the scope specified by a stereotype, simply by specifying a different scope for the bean.
The following declaration gives the `MockLoginAction` bean session scope instead of request scope:

[source,java]
----
@SessionScoped
@Action
@Mock
public class MockLoginAction extends LoginAction { ... }
----

CDI makes available a built-in stereotype called `Model`, which is intended for use with beans that define the model layer of a model-view-controller application architecture.
This stereotype specifies that a bean is both `@Named` and `@RequestScoped`:

[source,java]
----
@Named
@RequestScoped
@Stereotype
@Target({TYPE, METHOD, FIELD})
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Model {}
----
