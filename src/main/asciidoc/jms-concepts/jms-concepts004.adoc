== Using Advanced Jakarta Messaging Features

This section explains how to use features of Jakarta Messaging to
achieve the level of reliability and performance your application
requires. Many people use Jakarta Messaging in their applications
because they cannot tolerate dropped or duplicate messages and because
they require that every message be received once and only once. Jakarta
Messaging provides this functionality.

The most reliable way to produce a message is to send a `PERSISTENT`
message, and to do so within a transaction.

Jakarta Messaging messages are `PERSISTENT` by default; `PERSISTENT`
messages will not be lost in the event of Messaging provider failure.
For details, see <<specifying-message-persistence>>.

Transactions allow multiple messages to be sent or received in an
atomic operation. In the Jakarta EE platform they also allow message
sends and receives to be combined with database reads and writes in an
atomic transaction. A transaction is a unit of work into which you can
group a series of operations, such as message sends and receives, so
that the operations either all succeed or all fail. For details, see
<<using-jakarta-messaging-local-transactions>>.

The most reliable way to consume a message is to do so within a
transaction, either from a queue or from a durable subscription to a
topic. For details, see <<creating-durable-subscriptions>>,
<<creating-temporary-destinations>>, and
<<using-jakarta-messaging-local-transactions>>.

Some features primarily allow an application to improve performance.
For example, you can set messages to expire after a certain length of
time (see <<allowing-messages-to-expire>>), so that consumers do not
receive unnecessary outdated information. You can send messages
asynchronously; see <<sending-messages-asynchronously>>.

You can also specify various levels of control over message
acknowledgment; see <<controlling-message-acknowledgment>>.

Other features can provide useful capabilities unrelated to
reliability. For example, you can create temporary destinations that
last only for the duration of the connection in which they are created.
See <<creating-temporary-destinations>> for details.

The following sections describe these features as they apply to
application clients or Java SE clients. Some of the features work
differently in the Jakarta EE web or enterprise bean container; in
these cases, the differences are noted here and are explained in detail
in <<using-jakarta-messaging-in-jakarta-ee-applications>>.

=== Controlling Message Acknowledgment

Until a Jakarta Messaging message has been acknowledged, it is not
considered to be successfully consumed. The successful consumption of a
message ordinarily takes place in three stages.

. The client receives the message. 
. The client processes the message.
. The message is acknowledged. +
Acknowledgment is initiated either by the Messaging provider or by the
client, depending on the session acknowledgment mode.

In locally transacted sessions (see
<<using-jakarta-messaging-local-transactions>>), a message is
acknowledged when the session is committed. If a transaction is rolled
back, all consumed messages are redelivered.

In a Jakarta transaction (in the Jakarta EE web or enterprise bean
container) a message is acknowledged when the transaction is committed.

In nontransacted sessions, when and how a message is acknowledged
depend on a value that may be specified as an argument of the
`createContext` method. The possible argument values are as follows.

* `JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE`: This setting is the default for
application clients and Java SE clients. The `JMSContext` automatically
acknowledges a client's receipt of a message either when the client has
successfully returned from a call to `receive` or when the
`MessageListener` it has called to process the message returns
successfully.
+
A synchronous receive in a `JMSContext` that is configured to use
auto-acknowledgment is the one exception to the rule that message
consumption is a three-stage process as described earlier. In this
case, the receipt and acknowledgment take place in one step, followed
by the processing of the message.

* `JMSContext.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE`: A client acknowledges a message by
calling the message's `acknowledge` method. In this mode,
acknowledgment takes place on the session level: Acknowledging a
consumed message automatically acknowledges the receipt of all messages
that have been consumed by its session. For example, if a message
consumer consumes ten messages and then acknowledges the fifth message
delivered, all ten messages are acknowledged.
+
[NOTE]
In the Jakarta EE platform, the `JMSContext.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE` setting
can be used only in an application client, not in a web component or
enterprise bean.

* `JMSContext.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE`: This option instructs the
`JMSContext` to lazily acknowledge the delivery of messages. This is
likely to result in the delivery of some duplicate messages if the
Messaging provider fails, so it should be used only by consumers that
can tolerate duplicate messages. (If the Messaging provider redelivers
a message, it must set the value of the `JMSRedelivered` message header
to `true`.) This option can reduce session overhead by minimizing the
work the session does to prevent duplicates.

If messages have been received from a queue but not acknowledged when a
`JMSContext` is closed, the Messaging provider retains them and
redelivers them when a consumer next accesses the queue. The provider
also retains unacknowledged messages if an application closes a
`JMSContext` that has been consuming messages from a durable
subscription. (See <<creating-durable-subscriptions>>.) Unacknowledged
messages that have been received from a nondurable subscription will be
dropped when the `JMSContext` is closed.

If you use a queue or a durable subscription, you can use the
`JMSContext.recover` method to stop a nontransacted `JMSContext` and
restart it with its first unacknowledged message. In effect, the
``JMSContext``'s series of delivered messages is reset to the point
after its last acknowledged message. The messages it now delivers may
be different from those that were originally delivered, if messages
have expired or if higher-priority messages have arrived. For a
consumer on a nondurable subscription, the provider may drop
unacknowledged messages when the `JMSContext.recover` method is called.

The sample program in <<acknowledging-messages>> demonstrates two ways
to ensure that a message will not be acknowledged until processing of
the message is complete.

=== Specifying Options for Sending Messages

You can set a number of options when you send a message. These options
enable you to perform the tasks described in the following topics:

* <<specifying-message-persistence>> – Specify that messages are
persistent, meaning they must not be lost in the event of a provider
failure.

* <<setting-message-priority-levels>> – Set priority levels for
messages, which can affect the order in which the messages are
delivered.

* <<allowing-messages-to-expire>> – Specify an expiration time for
messages so they will not be delivered if they are obsolete.

* <<specifying-a-delivery-delay>> – Specify a delivery delay for
messages so that they will not be delivered until a specified amount of
time has expired.

* <<using-jmsproducer-method-chaining>> – Method chaining allows you to
specify more than one of these options when you create a producer and
call the `send` method.

==== Specifying Message Persistence

Jakarta Messaging supports two delivery modes specifying whether
messages are lost if the Messaging provider fails. These delivery modes
are fields of the `DeliveryMode` interface.

* The default delivery mode, `PERSISTENT`, instructs the Messaging
provider to take extra care to ensure that a message is not lost in
transit in case of a Messaging provider failure. A message sent with
this delivery mode is logged to stable storage when it is sent.

* The `NON_PERSISTENT` delivery mode does not require the Messaging
provider to store the message or otherwise guarantee that it is not
lost if the provider fails.

To specify the delivery mode, use the `setDeliveryMode` method of the
`JMSProducer` interface to set the delivery mode for all messages sent
by that producer.

You can use method chaining to set the delivery mode when you create a
producer and send a message. The following call creates a producer with
a `NON_PERSISTENT` delivery mode and uses it to send a message:

[source,java]
----
context.createProducer()
       .setDeliveryMode(DeliveryMode.NON_PERSISTENT).send(dest, msg);
----

If you do not specify a delivery mode, the default is `PERSISTENT`.
Using the `NON_PERSISTENT` delivery mode may improve performance and
reduce storage overhead, but you should use it only if your application
can afford to miss messages.

==== Setting Message Priority Levels

You can use message priority levels to instruct the Messaging provider
to deliver urgent messages first. Use the `setPriority` method of the
`JMSProducer` interface to set the priority level for all messages sent
by that producer.

You can use method chaining to set the priority level when you create a
producer and send a message. For example, the following call sets a
priority level of 7 for a producer and then sends a message:

[source,java]
----
context.createProducer().setPriority(7).send(dest, msg);
----

The ten levels of priority range from 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest). If you
do not specify a priority level, the default level is 4. A Messaging
provider tries to deliver higher-priority messages before
lower-priority ones, but does not have to deliver messages in exact
order of priority.

==== Allowing Messages to Expire

By default, a message never expires. If a message will become obsolete
after a certain period, however, you may want to set an expiration
time. Use the `setTimeToLive` method of the `JMSProducer` interface to
set a default expiration time for all messages sent by that producer.

For example, a message that contains rapidly changing data such as a
stock price will become obsolete after a few minutes, so you might
configure messages to expire after that time.

You can use method chaining to set the time to live when you create a
producer and send a message. For example, the following call sets a
time to live of five minutes for a producer and then sends a message:

[source,java]
----
context.createProducer().setTimeToLive(300000).send(dest, msg);
----

If the specified `timeToLive` value is `0`, the message never expires.

When the message is sent, the specified `timeToLive` is added to the
current time to give the expiration time. Any message not delivered
before the specified expiration time is destroyed. The destruction of
obsolete messages conserves storage and computing resources.

==== Specifying a Delivery Delay

You can specify a length of time that must elapse after a message is
sent before the Messaging provider delivers the message. Use the
`setDeliveryDelay` method of the `JMSProducer` interface to set a
delivery delay for all messages sent by that producer.

You can use method chaining to set the delivery delay when you create a
producer and send a message. For example, the following call sets a
delivery delay of 3 seconds for a producer and then sends a message:

[source,java]
----
context.createProducer().setDeliveryDelay(3000).send(dest, msg);
----

==== Using JMSProducer Method Chaining

The setter methods on the `JMSProducer` interface return `JMSProducer`
objects, so you can use method chaining to create a producer, set
multiple properties, and send a message. For example, the following
chained method calls create a producer, set a user-defined property,
set the expiration, delivery mode, and priority for the message, and
then send a message to a queue:

[source,java]
----
context.createProducer()
        .setProperty("MyProperty", "MyValue")
        .setTimeToLive(10000)
        .setDeliveryMode(NON_PERSISTENT)
        .setPriority(2)
        .send(queue, body);
----

You can also call the `JMSProducer` methods to set properties on a
message and then send the message in a separate `send` method call. You
can also set message properties directly on a message.

=== Creating Temporary Destinations

Normally, you create JMS destinations (queues and topics)
administratively rather than programmatically. Your Messaging provider
includes a tool to create and remove destinations, and it is common for
destinations to be long-lasting.

Jakarta Messaging also enables you to create destinations
(`TemporaryQueue` and `TemporaryTopic` objects) that last only for the
duration of the connection in which they are created. You create these
destinations dynamically using the `JMSContext.createTemporaryQueue`
and the `JMSContext.createTemporaryTopic` methods, as in the following
example:

[source,java]
----
TemporaryTopic replyTopic = context.createTemporaryTopic();
----

The only message consumers that can consume from a temporary
destination are those created by the same connection that created the
destination. Any message producer can send to the temporary
destination. If you close the connection to which a temporary
destination belongs, the destination is closed and its contents are
lost.

You can use temporary destinations to implement a simple request/reply
mechanism. If you create a temporary destination and specify it as the
value of the `JMSReplyTo` message header field when you send a message,
then the consumer of the message can use the value of the `JMSReplyTo`
field as the destination to which it sends a reply. The consumer can
also reference the original request by setting the `JMSCorrelationID`
header field of the reply message to the value of the `JMSMessageID`
header field of the request. For example, an `onMessage` method can
create a `JMSContext` so that it can send a reply to the message it
receives. It can use code such as the following:

[source,java]
----
replyMsg = context.createTextMessage("Consumer processed message: "
        + msg.getText());
replyMsg.setJMSCorrelationID(msg.getJMSMessageID());
context.createProducer().send((Topic) msg.getJMSReplyTo(), replyMsg);
----

For an example, see <<using-an-entity-to-join-messages-from-two-mdbs>>.

=== Using Jakarta Messaging Local Transactions

A transaction groups a series of operations into an atomic unit of
work. If any one of the operations fails, the transaction can be rolled
back, and the operations can be attempted again from the beginning. If
all the operations succeed, the transaction can be committed.

In an application client or a Java SE client, you can use local
transactions to group message sends and receives. You use the
`JMSContext.commit` method to commit a transaction. You can send
multiple messages in a transaction, and the messages will not be added
to the queue or topic until the transaction is committed. If you
receive multiple messages in a transaction, they will not be
acknowledged until the transaction is committed.

You can use the `JMSContext.rollback` method to roll back a
transaction. A transaction rollback means that all produced messages
are destroyed and all consumed messages are recovered and redelivered
unless they have expired (see <<allowing-messages-to-expire>>).

A transacted session is always involved in a transaction. To create a
transacted session, call the `createContext` method as follows:

[source,java]
----
JMSContext context =
        connectionFactory.createContext(JMSContext.SESSION_TRANSACTED);
----

As soon as the `commit` or the `rollback` method is called, one
transaction ends and another transaction begins. Closing a transacted
session rolls back its transaction in progress, including any pending
sends and receives.

In an application running in the Jakarta EE web or enterprise bean
container, you cannot use local transactions. Instead, you use Jakarta
Transactions, described in
<<using-jakarta-messaging-in-jakarta-ee-applications>>.

You can combine several sends and receives in a single Jakarta
Messaging local transaction, so long as they are all performed using
the same `JMSContext`.

Do not use a single transaction if you use a request/reply mechanism,
in which you send a message and then receive a reply to that message.
If you try to use a single transaction, the program will hang, because
the send cannot take place until the transaction is committed. The
following code fragment illustrates the problem:

[source,java]
----
// Don't do this!
outMsg.setJMSReplyTo(replyQueue);
context.createProducer().send(outQueue, outMsg);
consumer = context.createConsumer(replyQueue);
inMsg = consumer.receive();
context.commit();
----

Because a message sent during a transaction is not actually sent until
the transaction is committed, the transaction cannot contain any
receives that depend on that message's having been sent.

The production and the consumption of a message cannot both be part of
the same transaction. The reason is that the transactions take place
between the clients and the Messaging provider, which intervenes
between the production and the consumption of the message.
<<using-jakarta-messaging-local-transactions-2>> illustrates this
interaction.

[[using-jakarta-messaging-local-transactions-2]]
image::jakartaeett_dt_033.png["Diagram of local transactions, showing separate transactions for sending and consuming a message",title="Using Jakarta Messaging Local Transactions"]

The sending of one or more messages to one or more destinations by
Client 1 can form a single transaction, because it forms a single set
of interactions with the Messaging provider using a single
`JMSContext`. Similarly, the receiving of one or more messages from one
or more destinations by Client 2 also forms a single transaction using
a single `JMSContext`. But because the two clients have no direct
interaction and are using two different `JMSContext` objects, no
transactions can take place between them.

Another way of putting this is that a transaction is a contract between
a client and a Messaging provider that defines whether a message is
sent to a destination or whether a message is received from the
destination. It is not a contract between the sending client and the
receiving client.

This is the fundamental difference between messaging and synchronized
processing. Instead of tightly coupling the sender and the receiver of
a message, JMS couples the sender of a message with the destination,
and it separately couples the destination with the receiver of the
message. Therefore, while the sends and receives each have a tight
coupling with the Messaging provider, they do not have any coupling
with each other.

When you create a `JMSContext`, you can specify whether it is
transacted by using the `JMSContext.SESSION_TRANSACTED` argument to the
`createContext` method. For example:

[source,java]
----
try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext(
        JMSContext.SESSION_TRANSACTED);) {
    ...
}
----

The `commit` and the `rollback` methods for local transactions are
associated with the session that underlies the `JMSContext`. You can
combine operations on more than one queue or topic, or on a combination
of queues and topics, in a single transaction if you use the same
session to perform the operations. For example, you can use the same
`JMSContext` to receive a message from a queue and send a message to a
topic in the same transaction.

The example in <<using-local-transactions>> shows how to use Jakarta
Messaging local transactions.

=== Sending Messages Asynchronously

Normally, when you send a persistent message, the `send` method blocks
until the Messaging provider confirms that the message was sent
successfully. The asynchronous send mechanism allows your application
to send a message and continue work while waiting to learn whether the
send completed.

This feature is currently available only in application clients and
Java SE clients.

Sending a message asynchronously involves supplying a callback object.
You specify a `CompletionListener` with an `onCompletion` method. For
example, the following code instantiates a `CompletionListener` named
`SendListener`. It then calls the `setAsync` method to specify that
sends from this producer should be asynchronous and should use the
specified listener:

[source,java]
----
CompletionListener listener = new SendListener();
context.createProducer().setAsync(listener).send(dest, message);
----

The `CompletionListener` class must implement two methods,
`onCompletion` and `onException`. The `onCompletion` method is called
if the send succeeds, and the `onException` method is called if it
fails. A simple implementation of these methods might look like this:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public void onCompletion(Message message) {
    System.out.println("onCompletion method: Send has completed.");
}

@Override
public void onException(Message message, Exception e) {
    System.out.println("onException method: send failed: " + e.toString());
    System.out.println("Unsent message is: \n" + message);
}
----
