== Jakarta Messaging Programming Model

The basic building blocks of a Jakarta Messaging application are

* Administered objects: connection factories and destinations

* Connections

* Sessions

* `JMSContext` objects, which combine a connection and a session in one object

* Message producers

* Message consumers

* Messages

<<jakarta-messaging-programming-model-2>> shows how all these objects fit together in a Messaging client application.

[[jakarta-messaging-programming-model-2]]

Jakarta Messaging also provides queue browsers, objects that allow an application to browse messages on a queue.

This section describes all these objects briefly and provides sample commands and code snippets that show how to create and use the objects.
The last subsection briefly describes Jakarta Messaging API exception handling.

Examples that show how to combine all these objects in applications appear in xref:jakarta-messaging-examples[xrefstyle=full] beginning with <<writing-simple-jakarta-messaging-applications>>.
For more detail, see Jakarta Messaging documentation, part of the Jakarta EE API documentation.

=== Jakarta Messaging Administered Objects

Two parts of a Jakarta Messaging application, destinations and connection factories, are commonly maintained administratively rather than programmatically.
The technology underlying these objects is likely to be very different from one implementation of Jakarta Messaging to another.
Therefore, the management of these objects belongs with other administrative tasks that vary from provider to provider.

Messaging clients access administered objects through interfaces that are portable, so a client application can run with little or no change on more than one implementation of Jakarta Messaging.
Ordinarily, an administrator configures administered objects in a JNDI namespace, and Messaging clients then access them by using resource injection.

With GlassFish Server, you can use the `asadmin create-jms-resource` command or the Administration Console to create Jakarta Messaging administered objects in the form of connector resources.
You can also specify the resources in a file named `glassfish-resources.xml` that you can bundle with an application.

NetBeans IDE provides a wizard that allows you to create Jakarta Messaging resources for GlassFish Server.
See <<creating-jakarta-messaging-administered-objects>> for details.

The Jakarta EE platform specification allows a developer to create administered objects using annotations or deployment descriptor elements.
Objects created in this way are specific to the application for which they are created.
See <<creating-resources-for-jakarta-ee-applications>> for details.
Definitions in a deployment descriptor override those specified by annotations.

==== Jakarta Messaging Connection Factories

A connection factory is the object a client uses to create a connection to a provider.
A connection factory encapsulates a set of connection configuration parameters that has been defined by an administrator.
Each connection factory is an instance of the `ConnectionFactory`, `QueueConnectionFactory`, or `TopicConnectionFactory` interface.
To learn how to create connection factories, see <<creating-jakarta-messaging-administered-objects>>.

At the beginning of a Messaging client program, you usually inject a connection factory resource into a `ConnectionFactory` object.
A Jakarta EE server must provide a Jakarta Messaging connection factory with the logical JNDI name `java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory`.
The actual JNDI name will be implementation-specific.

For example, the following code fragment looks up the default Jakarta Messaging connection factory and assigns it to a `ConnectionFactory` object:

[source,java]
----
@Resource(lookup = "java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory")
private static ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;
----

==== Jakarta Messaging Destinations

A destination is the object a client uses to specify the target of messages it produces and the source of messages it consumes.
In the PTP messaging style, destinations are called queues.
In the pub/sub messaging style, destinations are called topics.
A Jakarta Messaging application can use multiple queues or topics (or both).
To learn how to create destination resources, see <<creating-jakarta-messaging-administered-objects>>.

To create a destination using GlassFish Server, you create a Jakarta Messaging destination resource that specifies a JNDI name for the destination.

In the GlassFish Server implementation of Jakarta Messaging, each destination resource refers to a physical destination.
You can create a physical destination explicitly, but if you do not, the Application Server creates it when it is needed and deletes it when you delete the destination resource.

In addition to injecting a connection factory resource into a client program, you usually inject a destination resource.
Unlike connection factories, destinations are specific to either the PTP or pub/sub messaging style.
To create an application that allows you to use the same code for both topics and queues, you assign the destination to a `Destination` object.

The following code specifies two resources, a queue and a topic.
The resource names are mapped to destination resources created in the JNDI namespace:

[source,java]
----
@Resource(lookup = "jms/MyQueue")
private static Queue queue;

@Resource(lookup = "jms/MyTopic")
private static Topic topic;
----

In a Jakarta EE application, Jakarta Messaging administered objects are normally placed in the `jms` naming subcontext.

With the common interfaces, you can mix or match connection factories and destinations.
That is, in addition to using the `ConnectionFactory` interface, you can inject a `QueueConnectionFactory` resource and use it with a `Topic`, and you can inject a `TopicConnectionFactory` resource and use it with a `Queue`.
The behavior of the application will depend on the kind of destination you use and not on the kind of connection factory you use.

=== Connections

A connection encapsulates a virtual connection with a Messaging provider.
For example, a connection could represent an open TCP/IP socket between a client and a provider service daemon.
You use a connection to create one or more sessions.

[NOTE]
In the Jakarta EE platform, the ability to create multiple sessions from a single connection is limited to application clients.
In web and enterprise bean components, a connection can create no more than one session.

You normally create a connection by creating a `JMSContext` object.
See <<jmscontext-objects>> for details.

=== Sessions

A session is a single-threaded context for producing and consuming messages.

You normally create a session (as well as a connection) by creating a `JMSContext` object.
See <<jmscontext-objects>> for details.
You use sessions to create message producers, message consumers, messages, queue browsers, and temporary destinations.

Sessions serialize the execution of message listeners; for details, see <<jakarta-messaging-message-listeners>>.

A session provides a transactional context with which to group a set of sends and receives into an atomic unit of work.
For details, see <<using-jakarta-messaging-local-transactions>>.

=== JMSContext Objects

A `JMSContext` object combines a connection and a session in a single object.
That is, it provides both an active connection to a Messaging provider and a single-threaded context for sending and receiving messages.

You use the `JMSContext` to create the following objects:

* Message producers

* Message consumers

* Messages

* Queue browsers

* Temporary queues and topics (see <<creating-temporary-destinations>>)

You can create a `JMSContext` in a `try`-with-resources block.

To create a `JMSContext`, call the `createContext` method on the connection factory:

[source,java]
----
JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();
----

When called with no arguments from an application client or a Java SE client, or from the Jakarta EE web or Enterprise Beans container when there is no active Jakarta Transactions transaction in progress, the `createContext` method creates a non-transacted session with an acknowledgment mode of `JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE`.
When called with no arguments from the web or Enterprise Beans container when there is an active JTA transaction in progress, the `createContext` method creates a transacted session.
For information about the way Jakarta Messaging transactions work in Jakarta EE applications, see <<using-jakarta-messaging-in-jakarta-ee-applications>>.

From an application client or a Java SE client, you can also call the `createContext` method with the argument `JMSContext.SESSION_TRANSACTED` to create a transacted session:

[source,java]
----
JMSContext context =
        connectionFactory.createContext(JMSContext.SESSION_TRANSACTED);
----

The session uses local transactions; see <<using-jakarta-messaging-local-transactions>> for details.

Alternatively, you can specify a non-default acknowledgment mode; see <<controlling-message-acknowledgment>> for more information.

When you use a `JMSContext`, message delivery normally begins as soon as you create a consumer.
See <<jakarta-messaging-message-consumers>> for more information.

If you create a `JMSContext` in a `try`-with-resources block, you do not need to close it explicitly.
It will be closed when the `try` block comes to an end.
Make sure that your application completes all its Jakarta Messaging activity within the `try`-with-resources block.
If you do not use a `try`-with-resources block, you must call the `close` method on the `JMSContext` to close the connection when the application has finished its work.

=== Jakarta Messaging Message Producers

A message producer is an object that is created by a `JMSContext` or a session and used for sending messages to a destination.
A message producer created by a `JMSContext` implements the `JMSProducer` interface.
You could create it this way:

[source,java]
----
try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();) {
    JMSProducer producer = context.createProducer();
    ...
}
----

However, a `JMSProducer` is a lightweight object that does not consume significant resources.
For this reason, you do not need to save the `JMSProducer` in a variable; you can create a new one each time you send a message.
You send messages to a specific destination by using the `send` method.
For example:

[source,java]
----
context.createProducer().send(dest, message);
----

You can create the message in a variable before sending it, as shown here, or you can create it within the `send` call.
See <<jakarta-messaging-messages>> for more information.

=== Jakarta Messaging Message Consumers

A message consumer is an object that is created by a `JMSContext` or a session and used for receiving messages sent to a destination.
A message producer created by a `JMSContext` implements the `JMSConsumer` interface.
The simplest way to create a message consumer is to use the `JMSContext.createConsumer` method:

[source,java]
----
try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();) {
    JMSConsumer consumer = context.createConsumer(dest);
    ...
}
----

A message consumer allows a Messaging client to register interest in a destination with a Messaging provider.
The Jakarta Messaging provider manages the delivery of messages from a destination to the registered consumers of the destination.

When you use a `JMSContext` to create a message consumer, message delivery begins as soon as you have created the consumer.
You can disable this behavior by calling `setAutoStart(false)` when you create the `JMSContext` and then calling the `start` method explicitly to start message delivery.
If you want to stop message delivery temporarily without closing the connection, you can call the `stop` method; to restart message delivery, call `start`.

You use the `receive` method to consume a message synchronously.
You can use this method at any time after you create the consumer.

If you specify no arguments or an argument of `0`, the method blocks indefinitely until a message arrives:

[source,java]
----
Message m = consumer.receive();
Message m = consumer.receive(0);
----

For a simple client, this may not matter.
But if it is possible that a message might not be available, use a synchronous receive with a timeout: Call the `receive` method with a timeout argument greater than `0`.
One second is a recommended timeout value:

[source,java]
----
Message m = consumer.receive(1000); // time out after a second
----

To enable asynchronous message delivery from an application client or a Java SE client, you use a message listener, as described in the next section.

You can use the `JMSContext.createDurableConsumer` method to create a durable topic subscription.
This method is valid only if you are using a topic.
For details, see <<creating-durable-subscriptions>>.
For topics, you can also create shared consumers; see <<creating-shared-subscriptions>>.

==== Jakarta Messaging Message Listeners

A message listener is an object that acts as an asynchronous event handler for messages.
This object implements the `MessageListener` interface, which contains one method, `onMessage`.
In the `onMessage` method, you define the actions to be taken when a message arrives.

From an application client or a Java SE client, you register the message listener with a specific message consumer by using the `setMessageListener` method.
For example, if you define a class named `Listener` that implements the `MessageListener` interface, you can register the message listener as follows:

[source,java]
----
Listener myListener = new Listener();
consumer.setMessageListener(myListener);
----

When message delivery begins, the Messaging provider automatically calls the message listener's `onMessage` method whenever a message is delivered.
The `onMessage` method takes one argument of type `Message`, which your implementation of the method can cast to another message subtype as needed (see <<message-bodies>>).

In the Jakarta EE web or Enterprise Beans container, you use message-driven beans for asynchronous message delivery.
A message-driven bean also implements the `MessageListener` interface and contains an `onMessage` method.
For details, see <<using-message-driven-beans-to-receive-messages-asynchronously>>.

Your `onMessage` method should handle all exceptions.
Throwing a `RuntimeException` is considered a programming error.

For a simple example of the use of a message listener, see <<using-a-message-listener-for-asynchronous-message-delivery>>.
xref:jakarta-messaging-examples[xrefstyle=full] contains several more examples of message listeners and message-driven beans.

==== Jakarta Messaging Message Selectors

If your messaging application needs to filter the messages it receives, you can use a Jakarta Messaging message selector, which allows a message consumer for a destination to specify the messages that interest it.
Message selectors assign the work of filtering messages to the Messaging provider rather than to the application.
For an example of an application that uses a message selector, see <<sending-messages-from-a-session-bean-to-an-mdb>>.

A message selector is a `String` that contains an expression.
The syntax of the expression is based on a subset of the SQL92 conditional expression syntax.
The message selector in the example selects any message that has a `NewsType` property that is set to the value `'Sports'` or `'Opinion'`:

[source,java]
----
NewsType = 'Sports' OR NewsType = 'Opinion'
----

The `createConsumer` and `createDurableConsumer` methods, as well as the methods for creating shared consumers, allow you to specify a message selector as an argument when you create a message consumer.

The message consumer then receives only messages whose headers and properties match the selector.
(See <<message-headers>> and <<message-properties>>.)
A message selector cannot select messages on the basis of the content of the message body.

==== Consuming Messages from Topics

The semantics of consuming messages from topics are more complex than the semantics of consuming messages from queues.

An application consumes messages from a topic by creating a subscription on that topic and creating a consumer on that subscription.
Subscriptions may be durable or nondurable, and they may be shared or unshared.

A subscription may be thought of as an entity within the Messaging provider itself, whereas a consumer is a Jakarta Messaging object within the application.

A subscription will receive a copy of every message that is sent to the topic after the subscription is created, unless a message selector is specified.
If a message selector is specified, only those messages whose properties match the message selector will be added to the subscription.

Unshared subscriptions are restricted to a single consumer.
In this case, all the messages in the subscription are delivered to that consumer.
Shared subscriptions allow multiple consumers.
In this case, each message in the subscription is delivered to only one consumer.
Jakarta Messaging does not define how messages are distributed between multiple consumers on the same subscription.

Subscriptions may be durable or nondurable.

A nondurable subscription exists only as long as there is an active consumer on the subscription.
This means that any messages sent to the topic will be added to the subscription only while a consumer exists and is not closed.

A nondurable subscription may be either unshared or shared.

* An unshared nondurable subscription does not have a name and may have only a single consumer object associated with it.
It is created automatically when the consumer object is created.
It is not persisted and is deleted automatically when the consumer object is closed.
+
The `JMSContext.createConsumer` method creates a consumer on an unshared nondurable subscription if a topic is specified as the destination.

* A shared nondurable subscription is identified by name and an optional client identifier, and may have several consumer objects consuming messages from it.
It is created automatically when the first consumer object is created.
It is not persisted and is deleted automatically when the last consumer object is closed.
See <<creating-shared-subscriptions>> for more information.

At the cost of higher overhead, a subscription may be durable.
A durable subscription is persisted and continues to accumulate messages until explicitly deleted, even if there are no consumer objects consuming messages from it.
See <<creating-durable-subscriptions>> for details.

==== Creating Durable Subscriptions

To ensure that a pub/sub application receives all sent messages, use durable subscriptions for the consumers on the topic.

Like a nondurable subscription, a durable subscription may be either unshared or shared.

* An unshared durable subscription is identified by name and client identifier (which must be set) and may have only a single consumer object associated with it.

* A shared durable subscription is identified by name and an optional client identifier, and may have several consumer objects consuming messages from it.

A durable subscription that exists but that does not currently have a non-closed consumer object associated with it is described as being inactive.

You can use the `JMSContext.createDurableConsumer` method to create a consumer on an unshared durable subscription.
An unshared durable subscription can have only one active consumer at a time.

A consumer identifies the durable subscription from which it consumes messages by specifying a unique identity that is retained by the Messaging provider.
Subsequent consumer objects that have the same identity resume the subscription in the state in which it was left by the preceding consumer.
If a durable subscription has no active consumer, the Messaging provider retains the subscription's messages until they are received by the subscription or until they expire.

You establish the unique identity of an unshared durable subscription by setting the following:

* A client ID for the connection

* A topic and a subscription name for the subscription

You can set the client ID administratively for a client-specific connection factory using either the command line or the Administration Console.
(In an application client or a Java SE client, you can instead call `JMSContext.setClientID`.)

After using this connection factory to create the `JMSContext`, you call the `createDurableConsumer` method with two arguments: the topic and a string that specifies the name of the subscription:

[source,java]
----
String subName = "MySub";
JMSConsumer consumer = context.createDurableConsumer(myTopic, subName);
----

The subscription becomes active after you create the consumer.
Later, you might close the consumer:

[source,java]
----
consumer.close();
----

The Messaging provider stores the messages sent to the topic, as it would store messages sent to a queue.
If the program or another application calls `createDurableConsumer` using the same connection factory and its client ID, the same topic, and the same subscription name, then the subscription is reactivated and the Messaging provider delivers the messages that were sent while the subscription was inactive.

To delete a durable subscription, first close the consumer, then call the `unsubscribe` method with the subscription name as the argument:

[source,java]
----
consumer.close();
context.unsubscribe(subName);
----

The `unsubscribe` method deletes the state the provider maintains for the subscription.

<<consumers-on-a-durable-subscription>> show the difference between a nondurable and a durable subscription.
With an ordinary, nondurable subscription, the consumer and the subscription begin and end at the same point and are, in effect, identical.
When the consumer is closed, the subscription also ends.
Here, `create` stands for a call to `JMSContext.createConsumer` with a `Topic` argument, and `close` stands for a call to `JMSConsumer.close`.
Any messages sent to the topic between the time of the first `close` and the time of the second `create` are not added to either subscription.
In <<nondurable-subscriptions-and-consumers>>, the consumers receive messages M1, M2, M5, and M6, but they do not receive messages M3 and M4.

[[nondurable-subscriptions-and-consumers]]
.Nondurable Subscriptions and Consumers
image::jakartaeett_dt_031.svg["Diagram showing messages being lost when nondurable subscriptions are used"]

With a durable subscription, the consumer can be closed and re-created, but the subscription continues to exist and to hold messages until the application calls the `unsubscribe` method.
In <<consumers-on-a-durable-subscription>>, `create` stands for a call to `JMSContext.createDurableConsumer`, `close` stands for a call to `JMSConsumer.close`, and `unsubscribe` stands for a call to `JMSContext.unsubscribe`.
Messages sent after the first consumer is closed are received when the second consumer is created (on the same durable subscription), so even though messages M2, M4, and M5 arrive while there is no consumer, they are not lost.

[[consumers-on-a-durable-subscription]]
.Consumers on a Durable Subscription
image::jakartaeett_dt_032.svg["Diagram showing messages being preserved when durable subscriptions are used"]

A shared durable subscription allows you to use multiple consumers to receive messages from a durable subscription.
If you use a shared durable subscription, the connection factory you use does not need to have a client identifier.
To create a shared durable subscription, call the `JMSContext.createSharedDurableConsumer` method, specifying the topic and subscription name:

[source,java]
----
JMSConsumer consumer =
        context.createSharedDurableConsumer(topic, "MakeItLast");
----

See <<acknowledging-messages>>, <<using-durable-subscriptions>>, <<using-shared-durable-subscriptions>>, and <<sending-messages-from-a-session-bean-to-an-mdb>> for examples of Jakarta EE applications that use durable subscriptions.

==== Creating Shared Subscriptions

A topic subscription created by the `createConsumer` or `createDurableConsumer` method can have only one consumer (although a topic can have many).
Multiple clients consuming from the same topic have, by definition, multiple subscriptions to the topic, and all the clients receive all the messages sent to the topic (unless they filter them with message selectors).

It is, however, possible to create a nondurable shared subscription to a topic by using the `createSharedConsumer` method and specifying not only a destination but a subscription name:

[source,java]
----
consumer = context.createSharedConsumer(topicName, "SubName");
----

With a shared subscription, messages will be distributed among multiple clients that use the same topic and subscription name.
Each message sent to the topic will be added to every subscription (subject to any message selectors), but each message added to a subscription will be delivered to only one of the consumers on that subscription, so it will be received by only one of the clients.
A shared subscription can be useful if you want to share the message load among several consumers on the subscription rather than having just one consumer on the subscription receive each message.
This feature can improve the scalability of Jakarta EE application client applications and Java SE applications.
(Message-driven beans share the work of processing messages from a topic among multiple threads.)

See <<using-shared-nondurable-subscriptions>> for a simple example of using shared nondurable consumers.

You can also create shared durable subscriptions by using the `JMSContext.createSharedDurableConsumer` method.
For details, see <<creating-durable-subscriptions>>.

=== Jakarta Messaging Messages

The ultimate purpose of a Jakarta Messaging application is to produce and consume messages that can then be used by other software applications.
Jakarta Messaging messages have a basic format that is simple but highly flexible, allowing you to create messages that match formats used by non-Jakarta Messaging applications on heterogeneous platforms.

A Jakarta Messaging message can have three parts: a header, properties, and a body.
Only the header is required.
The following sections describe these parts.

For complete documentation of message headers, properties, and bodies, see the documentation of the `Message` interface in the API documentation.
For a list of possible message types, see <<message-bodies>>.

==== Message Headers

A Jakarta Messaging message header contains a number of predefined fields that contain values used by both clients and providers to identify and route messages.
<<how-jakarta-messaging-message-header-field-values-are-set>> lists and describes the Jakarta Messaging message header fields and indicates how their values are set.
For example, every message has a unique identifier, which is represented in the header field `JMSMessageID`.
The value of another header field, `JMSDestination`, represents the queue or the topic to which the message is sent.
Other fields include a timestamp and a priority level.

Each header field has associated setter and getter methods, which are documented in the description of the `Message` interface.
Some header fields are intended to be set by a client, but many are set automatically by the `send` method, which overrides any client-set values.

[[how-jakarta-messaging-message-header-field-values-are-set]]
.How Jakarta Messaging Message Header Field Values Are Set
[width="99%",cols="20%,60%,20%"]
|===
|Header Field |Description |Set By

|`JMSDestination` |Destination to which the message is being sent |JMS provider `send` method

|`JMSDeliveryMode` |Delivery mode specified when the message was sent (see <<specifying-message-persistence>>) |Messaging provider `send` method

|`JMSDeliveryTime` |The time the message was sent plus the delivery delay specified when the message was sent (see <<specifying-a-delivery-delay>> |JMS provider `send` method

|`JMSExpiration` |Expiration time of the message (see <<allowing-messages-to-expire>>) |JMS provider `send` method

|`JMSPriority` |The priority of the message (see <<setting-message-priority-levels>>) |Jakarta Messaging provider `send` method

|`JMSMessageID` |Value that uniquely identifies each message sent by a provider |Messaging provider `send` method

|`JMSTimestamp` |The time the message was handed off to a provider to be sent |Messaging provider `send` method

|`JMSCorrelationID` |Value that links one message to another; commonly the `JMSMessageID` value is used |Client application

|`JMSReplyTo` |Destination where replies to the message should be sent |Client application

|`JMSType` |Type identifier supplied by client application |Client application

|`JMSRedelivered` |Whether the message is being redelivered |Jakarta Messaging provider prior to delivery
|===

==== Message Properties

You can create and set properties for messages if you need values in addition to those provided by the header fields.
You can use properties to provide compatibility with other messaging systems, or you can use them to create message selectors (see <<jakarta-messaging-message-selectors>>).
For an example of setting a property to be used as a message selector, see <<sending-messages-from-a-session-bean-to-an-mdb>>.

Jakarta Messaging provides some predefined property names that begin with `JMSX`.
A Messaging provider is required to implement only one of these, `JMSXDeliveryCount` (which specifies the number of times a message has been delivered); the rest are optional.
The use of these predefined properties or of user-defined properties in applications is optional.

==== Message Bodies

Jakarta Messaging defines six different types of messages.
Each message type corresponds to a different message body.
These message types allow you to send and receive data in many different forms.
<<jakarta-messaging-message-types>> describes these message types.

[[jakarta-messaging-message-types]]
.Jakarta Messaging Message Types
[width="75%",cols="15%,60%"]
|===
|Message Type |Body Contains

|`TextMessage` |A `java.lang.String` object (for example, the contents of an XML file).

|`MapMessage` |A set of name-value pairs, with names as `String` objects and values as primitive types in the Java programming language.
The entries can be accessed sequentially by enumerator or randomly by name.
The order of the entries is undefined.

|`BytesMessage` |A stream of uninterpreted bytes.
This message type is for literally encoding a body to match an existing message format.

|`StreamMessage` |A stream of primitive values in the Java programming language, filled and read sequentially.

|`ObjectMessage` |A `Serializable` object in the Java programming language.

|`Message` |Nothing.
Composed of header fields and properties only.
This message type is useful when a message body is not required.
|===

Jakarta Messaging provides methods for creating messages of each type and for filling in their contents.
For example, to create and send a `TextMessage`, you might use the following statements:

[source,java]
----
TextMessage message = context.createTextMessage();
message.setText(msg_text);     // msg_text is a String
context.createProducer().send(message);
----

At the consuming end, a message arrives as a generic `Message` object.
You can then cast the object to the appropriate message type and use more specific methods to access the body and extract the message contents (and its headers and properties if needed).
For example, you might use the stream-oriented read methods of `BytesMessage`.
You must always cast to the appropriate message type to retrieve the body of a `StreamMessage`.

Instead of casting the message to a message type, you can call the `getBody` method on the `Message`, specifying the type of the message as an argument.
For example, you can retrieve a `TextMessage` as a `String`.
The following code fragment uses the `getBody` method:

[source,java]
----
Message m = consumer.receive();
if (m instanceof TextMessage) {
    String message = m.getBody(String.class);
    System.out.println("Reading message: " + message);
} else {
    // Handle error or process another message type
}
----

Jakarta Messaging provides shortcuts for creating and receiving a `TextMessage`, `BytesMessage`, `MapMessage`, or `ObjectMessage`.
For example, you do not have to wrap a string in a `TextMessage`; instead, you can send and receive the string directly.
For example, you can send a string as follows:

[source,java]
----
String message = "This is a message";
context.createProducer().send(dest, message);
----

You can receive the message by using the `receiveBody` method:

[source,java]
----
String message = receiver.receiveBody(String.class);
----

You can use the `receiveBody` method to receive any type of message except `StreamMessage` and `Message`, as long as the body of the message can be assigned to a particular type.

An empty `Message` can be useful if you want to send a message that is simply a signal to the application.
Some of the examples in xref:jakarta-messaging-examples[xrefstyle=full], send an empty message after sending a series of text messages.
For example:

[source,java]
----
context.createProducer().send(dest, context.createMessage());
----

The consumer code can then interpret a non-text message as a signal that all the messages sent have now been received.

The examples in xref:jakarta-messaging-examples[xrefstyle=full], use messages of type `TextMessage`, `MapMessage`, and `Message`.

=== Jakarta Messaging Queue Browsers

Messages sent to a queue remain in the queue until the message consumer for that queue consumes them.
Jakarta Messaging provides a `QueueBrowser` object that allows you to browse the messages in the queue and display the header values for each message.
To create a `QueueBrowser` object, use the `JMSContext.createBrowser` method.

For example:

[source,java]
----
QueueBrowser browser = context.createBrowser(queue);
----

See <<browsing-messages-on-a-queue>> for an example of using a `QueueBrowser` object.

The `createBrowser` method allows you to specify a message selector as a second argument when you create a `QueueBrowser`.
For information on message selectors, see <<jakarta-messaging-message-selectors>>.

Jakarta Messaging provides no mechanism for browsing a topic.
Messages usually disappear from a topic as soon as they appear: If there are no message consumers to consume them, the Messaging provider removes them.
Although durable subscriptions allow messages to remain on a topic while the message consumer is not active, Jakarta Messaging does not define any facility for examining them.

=== Jakarta Messaging Exception Handling

The root class for all checked exceptions in Jakarta Messaging is `JMSException`.
The root cause for all unchecked exceptions in the Jakarta Messaging API is `JMSRuntimeException`.

Catching `JMSException` and `JMSRuntimeException` provides a generic way of handling all exceptions related to Jakarta Messaging.

The `JMSException` and `JMSRuntimeException` classes include the following subclasses, described in the API documentation:

* `IllegalStateException`, `IllegalStateRuntimeException`

* `InvalidClientIDException`, `InvalidClientIDRuntimeException`

* `InvalidDestinationException`, `InvalidDestinationRuntimeException`

* `InvalidSelectorException`, `InvalidSelectorRuntimeException`

* `JMSSecurityException`, `JMSSecurityRuntimeException`

* `MessageEOFException`

* `MessageFormatException`, `MessageFormatRuntimeException`

* `MessageNotReadableException`

* `MessageNotWriteableException`, `MessageNotWriteableRuntimeException`
