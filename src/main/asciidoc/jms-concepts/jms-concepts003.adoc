== Jakarta Messaging Programming Model

The basic building blocks of a Jakarta Messaging application are

* Administered objects: connection factories and destinations
* Connections
* Sessions
* `JMSContext` objects, which combine a connection and a session in one
object
* Message producers
* Message consumers
* Messages

<<jakarta-messaging-programming-model-2>> shows how all these objects
fit together in a Messaging client application.

[[jakarta-messaging-programming-model-2]]
image::jakartaeett_dt_030.png["Diagram of Jakarta Messaging programming model: connection factory, JMSContext, connection, session, message producer, message consumer, messages, and destinations",title="Jakarta Messaging Programming Model"]

Jakarta Messaging also provides queue browsers, objects that allow an
application to browse messages on a queue.

This section describes all these objects briefly and provides sample
commands and code snippets that show how to create and use the objects.
The last subsection briefly describes Jakarta Messaging API exception
handling.

Examples that show how to combine all these objects in applications
appear in xref:jakarta-messaging-examples[xrefstyle=full] beginning
with <<writing-simple-jakarta-messaging-applications>>. For more
detail, see Jakarta Messaging documentation, part of the Jakarta EE API
documentation.

=== Jakarta Messaging Administered Objects

Two parts of a Jakarta Messaging application, destinations and
connection factories, are commonly maintained administratively rather
than programmatically. The technology underlying these objects is
likely to be very different from one implementation of Jakarta
Messaging to another. Therefore, the management of these objects
belongs with other administrative tasks that vary from provider to
provider.

Messaging clients access administered objects through interfaces that
are portable, so a client application can run with little or no change
on more than one implementation of Jakarta Messaging. Ordinarily, an
administrator configures administered objects in a JNDI namespace, and
Messaging clients then access them by using resource injection.

With GlassFish Server, you can use the `asadmin create-jms-resource`
command or the Administration Console to create Jakarta Messaging
administered objects in the form of connector resources. You can also
specify the resources in a file named `glassfish-resources.xml` that
you can bundle with an application.

NetBeans IDE provides a wizard that allows you to create Jakarta
Messaging resources for GlassFish Server. See
<<creating-jakarta-messaging-administered-objects>> for details.

The Jakarta EE platform specification allows a developer to create
administered objects using annotations or deployment descriptor
elements. Objects created in this way are specific to the application
for which they are created. See
<<creating-resources-for-jakarta-ee-applications>> for details.
Definitions in a deployment descriptor override those specified by
annotations.

==== Jakarta Messaging Connection Factories

A connection factory is the object a client uses to create a connection
to a provider. A connection factory encapsulates a set of connection
configuration parameters that has been defined by an administrator.
Each connection factory is an instance of the `ConnectionFactory`,
`QueueConnectionFactory`, or `TopicConnectionFactory` interface. To
learn how to create connection factories, see
<<creating-jakarta-messaging-administered-objects>>.

At the beginning of a Messaging client program, you usually inject a
connection factory resource into a `ConnectionFactory` object. A
Jakarta EE server must provide a Jakarta Messaging connection factory
with the logical JNDI name `java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory`. The
actual JNDI name will be implementation-specific.

For example, the following code fragment looks up the default Jakarta
Messaging connection factory and assigns it to a `ConnectionFactory`
object:

[source,java]
----
@Resource(lookup = "java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory")
private static ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;
----

==== Jakarta Messaging Destinations

A destination is the object a client uses to specify the target of
messages it produces and the source of messages it consumes. In the PTP
messaging style, destinations are called queues. In the pub/sub
messaging style, destinations are called topics. A Jakarta Messaging
application can use multiple queues or topics (or both). To learn how
to create destination resources, see
<<creating-jakarta-messaging-administered-objects>>.

To create a destination using GlassFish Server, you create a Jakarta
Messaging destination resource that specifies a JNDI name for the
destination.

In the GlassFish Server implementation of Jakarta Messaging, each
destination resource refers to a physical destination. You can create a
physical destination explicitly, but if you do not, the Application
Server creates it when it is needed and deletes it when you delete the
destination resource.

In addition to injecting a connection factory resource into a client
program, you usually inject a destination resource. Unlike connection
factories, destinations are specific to either the PTP or pub/sub
messaging style. To create an application that allows you to use the
same code for both topics and queues, you assign the destination to a
`Destination` object.

The following code specifies two resources, a queue and a topic. The
resource names are mapped to destination resources created in the JNDI
namespace:

[source,java]
----
@Resource(lookup = "jms/MyQueue")
private static Queue queue;

@Resource(lookup = "jms/MyTopic")
private static Topic topic;
----

In a Jakarta EE application, Jakarta Messaging administered objects are
normally placed in the `jms` naming subcontext.

With the common interfaces, you can mix or match connection factories
and destinations. That is, in addition to using the `ConnectionFactory`
interface, you can inject a `QueueConnectionFactory` resource and use
it with a `Topic`, and you can inject a `TopicConnectionFactory`
resource and use it with a `Queue`. The behavior of the application
will depend on the kind of destination you use and not on the kind of
connection factory you use.

=== Connections

A connection encapsulates a virtual connection with a Messaging
provider. For example, a connection could represent an open TCP/IP
socket between a client and a provider service daemon. You use a
connection to create one or more sessions.

[NOTE]
In the Jakarta EE platform, the ability to create multiple sessions
from a single connection is limited to application clients. In web and
enterprise bean components, a connection can create no more than one
session.

You normally create a connection by creating a `JMSContext` object. See
<<jmscontext-objects>> for details.

=== Sessions

A session is a single-threaded context for producing and consuming
messages.

You normally create a session (as well as a connection) by creating a
`JMSContext` object. See <<jmscontext-objects>> for details. You use
sessions to create message producers, message consumers, messages,
queue browsers, and temporary destinations.

Sessions serialize the execution of message listeners; for details, see
<<jakarta-messaging-message-listeners>>.

A session provides a transactional context with which to group a set of
sends and receives into an atomic unit of work. For details, see
<<using-jakarta-messaging-local-transactions>>.

=== JMSContext Objects

A `JMSContext` object combines a connection and a session in a single
object. That is, it provides both an active connection to a Messaging
provider and a single-threaded context for sending and receiving
messages.

You use the `JMSContext` to create the following objects:

* Message producers
* Message consumers
* Messages
* Queue browsers
* Temporary queues and topics (see <<creating-temporary-destinations>>)

You can create a `JMSContext` in a `try`-with-resources block.

To create a `JMSContext`, call the `createContext` method on the
connection factory:

[source,java]
----
JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();
----

When called with no arguments from an application client or a Java SE
client, or from the Jakarta EE web or Enterprise Beans container when
there is no active Jakarta Transactions transaction in progress, the
`createContext` method creates a non-transacted session with an
acknowledgment mode of `JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE`. When called with
no arguments from the web or Enterprise Beans container when there is
an active JTA transaction in progress, the `createContext` method
creates a transacted session. For information about the way Jakarta
Messaging transactions work in Jakarta EE applications, see
<<using-jakarta-messaging-in-jakarta-ee-applications>>.

From an application client or a Java SE client, you can also call the
`createContext` method with the argument
`JMSContext.SESSION_TRANSACTED` to create a transacted session:

[source,java]
----
JMSContext context =
        connectionFactory.createContext(JMSContext.SESSION_TRANSACTED);
----

The session uses local transactions; see
<<using-jakarta-messaging-local-transactions>> for details.

Alternatively, you can specify a non-default acknowledgment mode; see
<<controlling-message-acknowledgment>> for more information.

When you use a `JMSContext`, message delivery normally begins as soon
as you create a consumer. See <<jakarta-messaging-message-consumers>>
for more information.

If you create a `JMSContext` in a `try`-with-resources block, you do
not need to close it explicitly. It will be closed when the `try` block
comes to an end. Make sure that your application completes all its
Jakarta Messaging activity within the `try`-with-resources block. If
you do not use a `try`-with-resources block, you must call the `close`
method on the `JMSContext` to close the connection when the application
has finished its work.

=== Jakarta Messaging Message Producers

A message producer is an object that is created by a `JMSContext` or a
session and used for sending messages to a destination. A message
producer created by a `JMSContext` implements the `JMSProducer`
interface. You could create it this way:

[source,java]
----
try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();) {
    JMSProducer producer = context.createProducer();
    ...
}
----

However, a `JMSProducer` is a lightweight object that does not consume
significant resources. For this reason, you do not need to save the
`JMSProducer` in a variable; you can create a new one each time you
send a message. You send messages to a specific destination by using
the `send` method. For example:

[source,java]
----
context.createProducer().send(dest, message);
----

You can create the message in a variable before sending it, as shown
here, or you can create it within the `send` call. See
<<jakarta-messaging-messages>> for more information.

=== Jakarta Messaging Message Consumers

A message consumer is an object that is created by a `JMSContext` or a
session and used for receiving messages sent to a destination. A
message producer created by a `JMSContext` implements the `JMSConsumer`
interface. The simplest way to create a message consumer is to use the
`JMSContext.createConsumer` method:

[source,java]
----
try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();) {
    JMSConsumer consumer = context.createConsumer(dest);
    ...
}
----

A message consumer allows a Messaging client to register interest in a
destination with a Messaging provider. The Jakarta Messaging provider
manages the delivery of messages from a destination to the registered
consumers of the destination.

When you use a `JMSContext` to create a message consumer, message
delivery begins as soon as you have created the consumer. You can
disable this behavior by calling `setAutoStart(false)` when you create
the `JMSContext` and then calling the `start` method explicitly to
start message delivery. If you want to stop message delivery
temporarily without closing the connection, you can call the `stop`
method; to restart message delivery, call `start`.

You use the `receive` method to consume a message synchronously. You
can use this method at any time after you create the consumer.

If you specify no arguments or an argument of `0`, the method blocks
indefinitely until a message arrives:

[source,java]
----
Message m = consumer.receive();
Message m = consumer.receive(0);
----

For a simple client, this may not matter. But if it is possible that a
message might not be available, use a synchronous receive with a
timeout: Call the `receive` method with a timeout argument greater than
`0`. One second is a recommended timeout value:

[source,java]
----
Message m = consumer.receive(1000); // time out after a second
----

To enable asynchronous message delivery from an application client or a
Java SE client, you use a message listener, as described in the next
section.

You can use the `JMSContext.createDurableConsumer` method to create a
durable topic subscription. This method is valid only if you are using
a topic. For details, see <<creating-durable-subscriptions>>. For
topics, you can also create shared consumers; see
<<creating-shared-subscriptions>>.

==== Jakarta Messaging Message Listeners

A message listener is an object that acts as an asynchronous event
handler for messages. This object implements the `MessageListener`
interface, which contains one method, `onMessage`. In the `onMessage`
method, you define the actions to be taken when a message arrives.

From an application client or a Java SE client, you register the
message listener with a specific message consumer by using the
`setMessageListener` method. For example, if you define a class named
`Listener` that implements the `MessageListener` interface, you can
register the message listener as follows:

[source,java]
----
Listener myListener = new Listener();
consumer.setMessageListener(myListener);
----

When message delivery begins, the Messaging provider automatically
calls the message listener's `onMessage` method whenever a message is
delivered. The `onMessage` method takes one argument of type `Message`,
which your implementation of the method can cast to another message
subtype as needed (see <<message-bodies>>).

In the Jakarta EE web or Enterprise Beans container, you use
message-driven beans for asynchronous message delivery. A
message-driven bean also implements the `MessageListener` interface and
contains an `onMessage` method. For details, see
<<using-message-driven-beans-to-receive-messages-asynchronously>>.

Your `onMessage` method should handle all exceptions. Throwing a
`RuntimeException` is considered a programming error.

For a simple example of the use of a message listener, see
<<using-a-message-listener-for-asynchronous-message-delivery>>.
xref:jakarta-messaging-examples[xrefstyle=full] contains several more
examples of message listeners and message-driven beans.

==== Jakarta Messaging Message Selectors

If your messaging application needs to filter the messages it receives,
you can use a Jakarta Messaging message selector, which allows a
message consumer for a destination to specify the messages that
interest it. Message selectors assign the work of filtering messages to
the Messaging provider rather than to the application. For an example
of an application that uses a message selector, see
<<sending-messages-from-a-session-bean-to-an-mdb>>.

A message selector is a `String` that contains an expression. The
syntax of the expression is based on a subset of the SQL92 conditional
expression syntax. The message selector in the example selects any
message that has a `NewsType` property that is set to the value
`'Sports'` or `'Opinion'`:

[source,java]
----
NewsType = 'Sports' OR NewsType = 'Opinion'
----

The `createConsumer` and `createDurableConsumer` methods, as well as
the methods for creating shared consumers, allow you to specify a
message selector as an argument when you create a message consumer.

The message consumer then receives only messages whose headers and
properties match the selector. (See <<message-headers>> and
<<message-properties>>.) A message selector cannot select messages on
the basis of the content of the message body.

==== Consuming Messages from Topics

The semantics of consuming messages from topics are more complex than
the semantics of consuming messages from queues.

An application consumes messages from a topic by creating a
subscription on that topic and creating a consumer on that
subscription. Subscriptions may be durable or nondurable, and they may
be shared or unshared.

A subscription may be thought of as an entity within the Messaging
provider itself, whereas a consumer is a Jakarta Messaging object
within the application.

A subscription will receive a copy of every message that is sent to the
topic after the subscription is created, unless a message selector is
specified. If a message selector is specified, only those messages
whose properties match the message selector will be added to the
subscription.

Unshared subscriptions are restricted to a single consumer. In this
case, all the messages in the subscription are delivered to that
consumer. Shared subscriptions allow multiple consumers. In this case,
each message in the subscription is delivered to only one consumer.
Jakarta Messaging does not define how messages are distributed between
multiple consumers on the same subscription.

Subscriptions may be durable or nondurable.

A nondurable subscription exists only as long as there is an active
consumer on the subscription. This means that any messages sent to the
topic will be added to the subscription only while a consumer exists
and is not closed.

A nondurable subscription may be either unshared or shared.

* An unshared nondurable subscription does not have a name and may have
only a single consumer object associated with it. It is created
automatically when the consumer object is created. It is not persisted
and is deleted automatically when the consumer object is closed.
+
The `JMSContext.createConsumer` method creates a consumer on an
unshared nondurable subscription if a topic is specified as the
destination.

* A shared nondurable subscription is identified by name and an
optional client identifier, and may have several consumer objects
consuming messages from it. It is created automatically when the first
consumer object is created. It is not persisted and is deleted
automatically when the last consumer object is closed. See
<<creating-shared-subscriptions>> for more information.

At the cost of higher overhead, a subscription may be durable. A
durable subscription is persisted and continues to accumulate messages
until explicitly deleted, even if there are no consumer objects
consuming messages from it. See <<creating-durable-subscriptions>> for
details.

==== Creating Durable Subscriptions

To ensure that a pub/sub application receives all sent messages, use
durable subscriptions for the consumers on the topic.

Like a nondurable subscription, a durable subscription may be either
unshared or shared.

* An unshared durable subscription is identified by name and client
identifier (which must be set) and may have only a single consumer
object associated with it.
* A shared durable subscription is identified by name and an optional
client identifier, and may have several consumer objects consuming
messages from it.

A durable subscription that exists but that does not currently have a
non-closed consumer object associated with it is described as being
inactive.

You can use the `JMSContext.createDurableConsumer` method to create a
consumer on an unshared durable subscription. An unshared durable
subscription can have only one active consumer at a time.

A consumer identifies the durable subscription from which it consumes
messages by specifying a unique identity that is retained by the
Messaging provider. Subsequent consumer objects that have the same
identity resume the subscription in the state in which it was left by
the preceding consumer. If a durable subscription has no active
consumer, the Messaging provider retains the subscription's messages
until they are received by the subscription or until they expire.

You establish the unique identity of an unshared durable subscription
by setting the following:

* A client ID for the connection
* A topic and a subscription name for the subscription

You can set the client ID administratively for a client-specific
connection factory using either the command line or the Administration
Console. (In an application client or a Java SE client, you can instead
call `JMSContext.setClientID`.)

After using this connection factory to create the `JMSContext`, you
call the `createDurableConsumer` method with two arguments: the topic
and a string that specifies the name of the subscription:

[source,java]
----
String subName = "MySub";
JMSConsumer consumer = context.createDurableConsumer(myTopic, subName);
----

The subscription becomes active after you create the consumer. Later,
you might close the consumer:

[source,java]
----
consumer.close();
----

The Messaging provider stores the messages sent to the topic, as it
would store messages sent to a queue. If the program or another
application calls `createDurableConsumer` using the same connection
factory and its client ID, the same topic, and the same subscription
name, then the subscription is reactivated and the Messaging provider
delivers the messages that were sent while the subscription was
inactive.

To delete a durable subscription, first close the consumer, then call
the `unsubscribe` method with the subscription name as the argument:

[source,java]
----
consumer.close();
context.unsubscribe(subName);
----

The `unsubscribe` method deletes the state the provider maintains for
the subscription.

<<consumers-on-a-durable-subscription>> show the difference between a
nondurable and a durable subscription. With an ordinary, nondurable
subscription, the consumer and the subscription begin and end at the
same point and are, in effect, identical. When the consumer is closed,
the subscription also ends. Here, `create` stands for a call to
`JMSContext.createConsumer` with a `Topic` argument, and `close` stands
for a call to `JMSConsumer.close`. Any messages sent to the topic
between the time of the first `close` and the time of the second
`create` are not added to either subscription. In
<<nondurable-subscriptions-and-consumers>>, the consumers receive
messages M1, M2, M5, and M6, but they do not receive messages M3 and
M4.

[[nondurable-subscriptions-and-consumers]]
image::jakartaeett_dt_031.png["Diagram showing messages being lost when nondurable subscriptions are used",title="Nondurable Subscriptions and Consumers"]

With a durable subscription, the consumer can be closed and re-created,
but the subscription continues to exist and to hold messages until the
application calls the `unsubscribe` method. In
<<consumers-on-a-durable-subscription>>, `create` stands for a call to
`JMSContext.createDurableConsumer`, `close` stands for a call to
`JMSConsumer.close`, and `unsubscribe` stands for a call to
`JMSContext.unsubscribe`. Messages sent after the first consumer is
closed are received when the second consumer is created (on the same
durable subscription), so even though messages M2, M4, and M5 arrive
while there is no consumer, they are not lost.

[[consumers-on-a-durable-subscription]]
image::jakartaeett_dt_032.png["Diagram showing messages being preserved when durable subscriptions are used",title="Consumers on a Durable Subscription"]

A shared durable subscription allows you to use multiple consumers to
receive messages from a durable subscription. If you use a shared
durable subscription, the connection factory you use does not need to
have a client identifier. To create a shared durable subscription, call
the `JMSContext.createSharedDurableConsumer` method, specifying the
topic and subscription name:

[source,java]
----
JMSConsumer consumer =
        context.createSharedDurableConsumer(topic, "MakeItLast");
----

See <<acknowledging-messages>>, <<using-durable-subscriptions>>,
<<using-shared-durable-subscriptions>>, and
<<sending-messages-from-a-session-bean-to-an-mdb>> for examples of
Jakarta EE applications that use durable subscriptions.

==== Creating Shared Subscriptions

A topic subscription created by the `createConsumer` or
`createDurableConsumer` method can have only one consumer (although a
topic can have many). Multiple clients consuming from the same topic
have, by definition, multiple subscriptions to the topic, and all the
clients receive all the messages sent to the topic (unless they filter
them with message selectors).

It is, however, possible to create a nondurable shared subscription to
a topic by using the `createSharedConsumer` method and specifying not
only a destination but a subscription name:

[source,java]
----
consumer = context.createSharedConsumer(topicName, "SubName");
----

With a shared subscription, messages will be distributed among multiple
clients that use the same topic and subscription name. Each message
sent to the topic will be added to every subscription (subject to any
message selectors), but each message added to a subscription will be
delivered to only one of the consumers on that subscription, so it will
be received by only one of the clients. A shared subscription can be
useful if you want to share the message load among several consumers on
the subscription rather than having just one consumer on the
subscription receive each message. This feature can improve the
scalability of Java EE application client applications and Java SE
applications. (Message-driven beans share the work of processing
messages from a topic among multiple threads.)

See <<using-shared-nondurable-subscriptions>> for a simple example of
using shared nondurable consumers.

You can also create shared durable subscriptions by using the
`JMSContext.createSharedDurableConsumer` method. For details, see
<<creating-durable-subscriptions>>.

=== Jakarta Messaging Messages

The ultimate purpose of a Jakarta Messaging application is to produce
and consume messages that can then be used by other software
applications. Jakarta Messaging messages have a basic format that is
simple but highly flexible, allowing you to create messages that match
formats used by non-Jakarta Messaging applications on heterogeneous
platforms.

A Jakarta Messaging message can have three parts: a header, properties,
and a body. Only the header is required. The following sections
describe these parts.

For complete documentation of message headers, properties, and bodies,
see the documentation of the `Message` interface in the API
documentation. For a list of possible message types, see
<<message-bodies>>.

==== Message Headers

A Jakarta Messaging message header contains a number of predefined
fields that contain values used by both clients and providers to
identify and route messages.
<<how-jakarta-messaging-message-header-field-values-are-set>> lists and
describes the Jakarta Messaging message header fields and indicates how
their values are set. For example, every message has a unique
identifier, which is represented in the header field `JMSMessageID`.
The value of another header field, `JMSDestination`, represents the
queue or the topic to which the message is sent. Other fields include a
timestamp and a priority level.

Each header field has associated setter and getter methods, which are
documented in the description of the `Message` interface. Some header
fields are intended to be set by a client, but many are set
automatically by the `send` method, which overrides any client-set
values.

[[how-jakarta-messaging-message-header-field-values-are-set]]
[width="99%",cols="20%,60%,20%",title="How Jakarta Messaging Message Header Field Values Are Set"]
|===
|Header Field |Description |Set By

|`JMSDestination` |Destination to which the message is being sent |JMS
provider `send` method

|`JMSDeliveryMode` |Delivery mode specified when the message was sent
(see <<specifying-message-persistence>>) |Messaging provider `send`
method

|`JMSDeliveryTime` |The time the message was sent plus the delivery
delay specified when the message was sent (see
<<specifying-a-delivery-delay>> |JMS provider `send` method

|`JMSExpiration` |Expiration time of the message (see
<<allowing-messages-to-expire>>) |JMS provider `send` method

|`JMSPriority` |The priority of the message (see
<<setting-message-priority-levels>>) |Jakarta Messaging provider `send`
method

|`JMSMessageID` |Value that uniquely identifies each message sent by a
provider |Messaging provider `send` method

|`JMSTimestamp` |The time the message was handed off to a provider to
be sent |Messaging provider `send` method

|`JMSCorrelationID` |Value that links one message to another; commonly
the `JMSMessageID` value is used |Client application

|`JMSReplyTo` |Destination where replies to the message should be sent
|Client application

|`JMSType` |Type identifier supplied by client application |Client
application

|`JMSRedelivered` |Whether the message is being redelivered |Jakarta
Messaging provider prior to delivery
|===

==== Message Properties

You can create and set properties for messages if you need values in
addition to those provided by the header fields. You can use properties
to provide compatibility with other messaging systems, or you can use
them to create message selectors (see
<<jakarta-messaging-message-selectors>>). For an example of setting a
property to be used as a message selector, see
<<sending-messages-from-a-session-bean-to-an-mdb>>.

Jakarta Messaging provides some predefined property names that begin
with `JMSX`. A Messaging provider is required to implement only one of
these, `JMSXDeliveryCount` (which specifies the number of times a
message has been delivered); the rest are optional. The use of these
predefined properties or of user-defined properties in applications is
optional.

==== Message Bodies

Jakarta Messaging defines six different types of messages. Each message
type corresponds to a different message body. These message types allow
you to send and receive data in many different forms.
<<jakarta-messaging-message-types>> describes these message types.

[[jakarta-messaging-message-types]]
[width="75%",cols="15%,60%",title="Jakarta Messaging Message Types"]
|===
|Message Type |Body Contains

|`TextMessage` |A `java.lang.String` object (for example, the contents
of an XML file).

|`MapMessage` |A set of name-value pairs, with names as `String`
objects and values as primitive types in the Java programming language.
The entries can be accessed sequentially by enumerator or randomly by
name. The order of the entries is undefined.

|`BytesMessage` |A stream of uninterpreted bytes. This message type is
for literally encoding a body to match an existing message format.

|`StreamMessage` |A stream of primitive values in the Java programming
language, filled and read sequentially.

|`ObjectMessage` |A `Serializable` object in the Java programming
language.

|`Message` |Nothing. Composed of header fields and properties only.
This message type is useful when a message body is not required.
|===

Jakarta Messaging provides methods for creating messages of each type
and for filling in their contents. For example, to create and send a
`TextMessage`, you might use the following statements:

[source,java]
----
TextMessage message = context.createTextMessage();
message.setText(msg_text);     // msg_text is a String
context.createProducer().send(message);
----

At the consuming end, a message arrives as a generic `Message` object.
You can then cast the object to the appropriate message type and use
more specific methods to access the body and extract the message
contents (and its headers and properties if needed). For example, you
might use the stream-oriented read methods of `BytesMessage`. You must
always cast to the appropriate message type to retrieve the body of a
`StreamMessage`.

Instead of casting the message to a message type, you can call the
`getBody` method on the `Message`, specifying the type of the message
as an argument. For example, you can retrieve a `TextMessage` as a
`String`. The following code fragment uses the `getBody` method:

[source,java]
----
Message m = consumer.receive();
if (m instanceof TextMessage) {
    String message = m.getBody(String.class);
    System.out.println("Reading message: " + message);
} else {
    // Handle error or process another message type
}
----

Jakarta Messaging provides shortcuts for creating and receiving a
`TextMessage`, `BytesMessage`, `MapMessage`, or `ObjectMessage`. For
example, you do not have to wrap a string in a `TextMessage`; instead,
you can send and receive the string directly. For example, you can send
a string as follows:

[source,java]
----
String message = "This is a message";
context.createProducer().send(dest, message);
----

You can receive the message by using the `receiveBody` method:

[source,java]
----
String message = receiver.receiveBody(String.class);
----

You can use the `receiveBody` method to receive any type of message
except `StreamMessage` and `Message`, as long as the body of the
message can be assigned to a particular type.

An empty `Message` can be useful if you want to send a message that is
simply a signal to the application. Some of the examples in
xref:jakarta-messaging-examples[xrefstyle=full], send an empty message
after sending a series of text messages. For example:

[source,java]
----
context.createProducer().send(dest, context.createMessage());
----

The consumer code can then interpret a non-text message as a signal
that all the messages sent have now been received.

The examples in xref:jakarta-messaging-examples[xrefstyle=full], use
messages of type `TextMessage`, `MapMessage`, and `Message`.

=== Jakarta Messaging Queue Browsers

Messages sent to a queue remain in the queue until the message consumer
for that queue consumes them. Jakarta Messaging provides a
`QueueBrowser` object that allows you to browse the messages in the
queue and display the header values for each message. To create a
`QueueBrowser` object, use the `JMSContext.createBrowser` method. For
example:

[source,java]
----
QueueBrowser browser = context.createBrowser(queue);
----

See <<browsing-messages-on-a-queue>> for an example of using a
`QueueBrowser` object.

The `createBrowser` method allows you to specify a message selector as
a second argument when you create a `QueueBrowser`. For information on
message selectors, see <<jakarta-messaging-message-selectors>>.

Jakarta Messaging provides no mechanism for browsing a topic. Messages
usually disappear from a topic as soon as they appear: If there are no
message consumers to consume them, the Messaging provider removes them.
Although durable subscriptions allow messages to remain on a topic
while the message consumer is not active, Jakarta Messaging does not
define any facility for examining them.

=== Jakarta Messaging Exception Handling

The root class for all checked exceptions in Jakarta Messaging is
`JMSException`. The root cause for all unchecked exceptions in the
Jakarta Messaging API is `JMSRuntimeException`.

Catching `JMSException` and `JMSRuntimeException` provides a generic
way of handling all exceptions related to Jakarta Messaging.

The `JMSException` and `JMSRuntimeException` classes include the
following subclasses, described in the API documentation:

* `IllegalStateException`, `IllegalStateRuntimeException`
* `InvalidClientIDException`, `InvalidClientIDRuntimeException`
* `InvalidDestinationException`, `InvalidDestinationRuntimeException`
* `InvalidSelectorException`, `InvalidSelectorRuntimeException`
* `JMSSecurityException`, `JMSSecurityRuntimeException`
* `MessageEOFException`
* `MessageFormatException`, `MessageFormatRuntimeException`
* `MessageNotReadableException`
* `MessageNotWriteableException`, `MessageNotWriteableRuntimeException`
* `ResourceAllocationException`, `ResourceAllocationRuntimeException`
* `TransactionInProgressException`,
`TransactionInProgressRuntimeException`
* `TransactionRolledBackException`,
`TransactionRolledBackRuntimeException`

All the examples in the tutorial catch and handle `JMSException` or
`JMSRuntimeException` when it is appropriate to do so.
