== Transactions in Jakarta EE Applications

In a Jakarta EE application, a transaction is a series of actions that must all complete successfully, or else all the changes in each action are backed out.
Transactions end in either a commit or a rollback.

Jakarta Transactions allows applications to access transactions in a manner that is independent of specific implementations.
Jakarta Transactions specifies standard Java interfaces between a transaction manager and the parties involved in a distributed transaction system: the transactional application, the Jakarta EE server, and the manager that controls access to the shared resources affected by the transactions.

Jakarta Transactions defines the `UserTransaction` interface that applications use to start, commit, or roll back transactions.
Application components get a `UserTransaction` object through a JNDI lookup by using the name `java:comp/UserTransaction` or by requesting injection of a `UserTransaction` object.
An application server uses a number of Jakarta Transactions defined interfaces to communicate with a transaction manager; a transaction manager uses Jakarta Transactions defined interfaces to interact with a resource manager.

The Jakarta Transactions 2.0 specification is available at https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/2.0/[^].
