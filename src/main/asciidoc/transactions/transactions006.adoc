== Transaction Timeouts

For container-managed transactions, you can use the Administration
Console to configure the transaction timeout interval. See
<<starting-the-administration-console>>.

For enterprise beans with bean-managed Jakarta transactions, you invoke
the `setTransactionTimeout` method of the `UserTransaction` interface.

=== To Set a Transaction Timeout

. In the Administration Console, expand the Configurations node, then
expand the server-config node and select Transaction Service.
. On the Transaction Service page, set the value of the Transaction
Timeout field to the value of your choice (for example, 5).
+
With this setting, if the transaction has not completed within 5
seconds, the enterprise bean container rolls it back.
+
The default value is 0, meaning that the transaction will not time out.
. Click Save.
