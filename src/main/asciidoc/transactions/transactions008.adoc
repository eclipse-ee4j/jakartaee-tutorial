== Transactions in Web Components

You can demarcate a transaction in a web component by using either the `java.sql.Connection` or the `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface.
These are the same interfaces that a session bean with bean-managed transactions can use.
Transactions demarcated with the `UserTransaction` interface are discussed in <<jakarta-transactions-2>>.
