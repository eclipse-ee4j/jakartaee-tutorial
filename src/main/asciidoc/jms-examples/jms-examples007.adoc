== Receiving Messages Asynchronously Using a Message-Driven Bean

If you are writing an application to run in the Jakarta EE application
client container or on the Java SE platform, and you want to receive
messages asynchronously, you need to define a class that implements the
`MessageListener` interface, create a `JMSConsumer`, and call the method
`setMessageListener`.

If you're writing an application to run in the Jakarta EE web or enterprise bean
container and want it to receive messages asynchronously, you also need
to need to define a class that implements the `MessageListener`
interface. However, instead of creating a `JMSConsumer` and calling the
method `setMessageListener`, you must configure your message listener
class to be a message-driven bean. The application server will then take
care of the rest.

Message-driven beans can implement any messaging type. Most commonly,
however, they implement the Jakarta Messaging technology.

This section describes a simple message-driven bean example. Before
proceeding, you should read the basic conceptual information in the
section link:#GIPKO[What Is a Message-Driven Bean?] as
well as link:#BNCGQ[Using Message-Driven Beans to
Receive Messages Asynchronously].

[[BNBPL]][[overview-of-the-simplemessage-example]]

=== Overview of the simplemessage Example

The `simplemessage` application has the following components:

* `SimpleMessageClient`: An application client that sends several
messages to a queue
* `SimpleMessageBean`: A message-driven bean that asynchronously
processes the messages that are sent to the queue

link:#BNBPM[Figure 49-3] illustrates the structure of this application.
The application client sends messages to the queue, which was created
administratively using the Administration Console. The Messaging provider (in
this case, GlassFish Server) delivers the messages to the instances of
the message-driven bean, which then processes the messages.

to a queue, and the message being delivered to a message-driven bean"]

The source code for this application is in the
`_tut-install_/examples/jms/simplemessage/` directory.

[[BNBPN]][[the-simplemessage-application-client]]

=== The simplemessage Application Client

The `SimpleMessageClient` sends messages to the queue that the
`SimpleMessageBean` listens to. The client starts by injecting the
connection factory and queue resources:

[source,java]
----
@Resource(lookup = "java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory")
private static ConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

@Resource(lookup = "jms/MyQueue")
private static Queue queue;
----

Next, the client creates the `JMSContext` in a `try`-with-resources
block:

[source,java]
----
String text;
final int NUM_MSGS = 3;

try (JMSContext context = connectionFactory.createContext();) {
----

Finally, the client sends several text messages to the queue:

[source,java]
----
for (int i = 0; i < NUM_MSGS; i++) {
    text = "This is message " + (i + 1);
    System.out.println("Sending message: " + text);
    context.createProducer().send(queue, text);
}
----

[[BNBPO]][[the-simplemessage-message-driven-bean-class]]

=== The simplemessage Message-Driven Bean Class

The code for the `SimpleMessageBean` class illustrates the requirements
of a message-driven bean class described in
link:#BNCGQ[Using Message-Driven Beans to Receive
Messages Asynchronously].

The first few lines of the `SimpleMessageBean` class use the
`@MessageDriven` annotation's `activationConfig` attribute to specify
configuration properties:

[source,java]
----
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup",
            propertyValue = "jms/MyQueue"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType",
            propertyValue = "javax.jms.Queue")
})
----

See link:#GJKOH[Table 48-3] for a list of the
available properties.

See link:#BNCGW[Sending Messages from a Session Bean
to an MDB] for examples of the `subscriptionDurability`, `clientId`,
`subscriptionName`, and `messageSelector` properties.

[[BNBPP]][[the-onmessage-method]]

==== The onMessage Method

When the queue receives a message, the enterprise bean container invokes the message
listener method or methods. For a bean that uses Jakarta Messaging, this is the
`onMessage` method of the `MessageListener` interface.

In the `SimpleMessageBean` class, the `onMessage` method casts the
incoming message to a `TextMessage` and displays the text:

[source,java]
----
public void onMessage(Message inMessage) {

    try {
        if (inMessage instanceof TextMessage) {
            logger.log(Level.INFO,
                    "MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: {0}",
                    inMessage.getBody(String.class));
        } else {
            logger.log(Level.WARNING,
                    "Message of wrong type: {0}",
                    inMessage.getClass().getName());
        }
    } catch (JMSException e) {
        logger.log(Level.SEVERE,
                "SimpleMessageBean.onMessage: JMSException: {0}",
                e.toString());
        mdc.setRollbackOnly();
    }
}

=== Running the simplemessage Example

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, deploy, and run the
`simplemessage` example.

[[BNBPR]][[creating-resources-for-the-simplemessage-example]]

==== Creating Resources for the simplemessage Example

This example uses the queue named `jms/MyQueue` and the preconfigured
default connection factory `java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory`.

If you have run the simple Jakarta Messaging examples in
link:#BNCFA[Writing Simple Jakarta Messaging Applications] and have
not deleted the resources, you already have the queue. Otherwise, follow
the instructions in link:#BABHEFCB[To Create
Resources for the Simple Examples] to create it.

For more information on creating Messaging resources, see
link:#GKTJS[Creating Jakarta Messaging Administered Objects].

[[CHDFBDDA]][[to-run-the-simplemessage-example-using-netbeans-ide]]

==== To Run the simplemessage Example Using NetBeans IDE

1.  Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see
link:#BNADI[Starting and Stopping GlassFish
Server]).
2.  From the File menu, choose Open Project.
3.  In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
[source,java]
----
tut-install/examples/jms/simplemessage
----
4.  Select the `simplemessage` folder.
5.  Make sure that the Open Required Projects check box is selected,
then click Open Project.
6.  In the Projects tab, right-click the `simplemessage` project and
select Build. (If NetBeans IDE suggests that you run a priming build,
click the box to do so.)
+
This command packages the application client and the message-driven
bean, then creates a file named `simplemessage.ear` in the
`simplemessage-ear/target/` directory. It then deploys the
`simplemessage-ear` module, retrieves the client stubs, and runs the
application client.
+
The output in the output window looks like this (preceded by application
client container output):
+
[source,java]
----
Sending message: This is message 1
Sending message: This is message 2
Sending message: This is message 3
To see if the bean received the messages,
 check <install_dir>/domains/domain1/logs/server.log.
----
+
In the server log file, lines similar to the following appear:
+
[source,java]
----
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 1
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 2
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 3
----
+
The received messages may appear in a different order from the order in
which they were sent.
7.  After you have finished running the application, undeploy it using
the Services tab.

[[BNBPT]][[to-run-the-simplemessage-example-using-maven]]

==== To Run the simplemessage Example Using Maven

1.  Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see
link:#BNADI[Starting and Stopping GlassFish
Server]).
2.  In a terminal window, go to:
+
[source,java]
----
tut-install/examples/jms/simplemessage/
----
3.  To compile the source files and package the application, use the
following command:
+
[source,java]
----
mvn install
----
+
This target packages the application client and the message-driven bean,
then creates a file named `simplemessage.ear` in the
`simplemessage-ear/target/` directory. It then deploys the
`simplemessage-ear` module, retrieves the client stubs, and runs the
application client.
+
The output in the terminal window looks like this (preceded by
application client container output):
+
[source,java]
----
Sending message: This is message 1
Sending message: This is message 2
Sending message: This is message 3
To see if the bean received the messages,
 check <install_dir>/domains/domain1/logs/server.log.
----
+
In the server log file, lines similar to the following appear:
+
[source,java]
----
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 1
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 2
MESSAGE BEAN: Message received: This is message 3
----
+
The received messages may appear in a different order from the order in
which they were sent.
4.  After you have finished running the application, undeploy it using
the `mvn cargo:undeploy` command.
