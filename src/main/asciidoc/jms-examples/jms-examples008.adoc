== Sending Messages from a Session Bean to an MDB

This section explains how to write, compile, package, deploy, and run an application that uses Jakarta Messaging in conjunction with a session bean.
The application contains the following components:

* An application client that invokes a session bean

* A session bean that publishes several messages to a topic

* A message-driven bean that receives and processes the messages using a durable topic subscription and a message selector

You will find the source files for this section in the `_tut-install_/examples/jms/clientsessionmdb/` directory.
Path names in this section are relative to this directory.

=== Writing the Application Components for the clientsessionmdb Example

This application demonstrates how to send messages from an enterprise bean (in this case, a session bean) rather than from an application client, as in the example in <<receiving-messages-asynchronously-using-a-message-driven-bean>>.
<<an-enterprise-bean-application-client-to-session-bean-to-message-driven-bean>> illustrates the structure of this application.
Sending messages from an enterprise bean is very similar to sending messages from a managed bean, which was shown in <<sending-and-receiving-messages-using-a-simple-web-application>>.

.An Enterprise Bean Application: Client to Session Bean to Message-Driven Bean
image::jakartaeett_dt_037.svg["Diagram of application showing an application client calling a session bean, which sends messages that are processed by a message-driven bean"]

The Publisher enterprise bean in this example is the enterprise-application equivalent of a wire-service news feed that categorizes news events into six news categories.
The message-driven bean could represent a newsroom, where the sports desk, for example, would set up a subscription for all news events pertaining to sports.

The application client in the example injects the Publisher enterprise bean's remote home interface and then calls the bean's business method.
The enterprise bean creates 18 text messages.
For each message, it sets a `String` property randomly to one of six values representing the news categories and then publishes the message to a topic.
The message-driven bean uses a message selector for the property to limit which of the published messages will be delivered to it.

==== Coding the Application Client: MyAppClient.java

The application client, `MyAppClient.java`, found under `clientsessionmdb-app-client`, performs no Messaging operations and so is simpler than the client in <<receiving-messages-asynchronously-using-a-message-driven-bean>>.
The client uses dependency injection to obtain the Publisher enterprise bean's business interface:

[source,java]
----
@EJB(name="PublisherRemote")
private static PublisherRemote publisher;
----

The client then calls the bean's business method twice.

==== Coding the Publisher Session Bean

The Publisher bean is a stateless session bean that has one business method.
The Publisher bean uses a remote interface rather than a local interface because it is accessed from the application client.

The remote interface, `PublisherRemote.java`, found under `clientsessionmdb-ejb`, declares a single business method, `publishNews`.

The bean class, `PublisherBean.java`, also found under `clientsessionmdb-ejb`, implements the `publishNews` method and its helper method `chooseType`.
The bean class injects `SessionContext` and `Topic` resources (the topic is defined in the message-driven bean).
It then injects a `JMSContext`, which uses the preconfigured default connection factory unless you specify otherwise.
The bean class begins as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Stateless
@Remote({
    PublisherRemote.class
})
public class PublisherBean implements PublisherRemote {

    @Resource
    private SessionContext sc;
    @Resource(lookup = "java:module/jms/newsTopic")
    private Topic topic;
    @Inject
    private JMSContext context;
    ...
}
----

The business method `publishNews` creates a `JMSProducer` and publishes the messages.

==== Coding the Message-Driven Bean: MessageBean.java

The message-driven bean class, `MessageBean.java`, found under `clientsessionmdb-ejb`, is almost identical to the one in <<receiving-messages-asynchronously-using-a-message-driven-bean>>.
However, the `@MessageDriven` annotation is different, because instead of a queue, the bean is using a topic, a durable subscription, and a message selector.
The bean defines a topic for the use of the application; the definition uses the `java:module` scope because both the session bean and the message-driven bean are in the same module.
Because the destination is defined in the message-driven bean, the `@MessageDriven` annotation uses the `destinationLookup` activation config property.
(See <<creating-resources-for-jakarta-ee-applications>> for more information.)
The annotation also sets the activation config properties `messageSelector`, `subscriptionDurability`, `clientId`, and `subscriptionName`, as follows:

[source,java]
----
@JMSDestinationDefinition(
        name = "java:module/jms/newsTopic",
        interfaceName = "jakarta.jms.Topic",
        destinationName = "PhysicalNewsTopic")
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup",
            propertyValue = "java:module/jms/newsTopic"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType",
            propertyValue = "jakarta.jms.Topic"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "messageSelector",
            propertyValue = "NewsType = 'Sports' OR NewsType = 'Opinion'"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "subscriptionDurability",
            propertyValue = "Durable"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "clientId",
            propertyValue = "MyID"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "subscriptionName",
            propertyValue = "MySub")
})
----

The topic is the one defined in the `PublisherBean`.
The message selector in this case represents both the sports and opinion desks, just to demonstrate the syntax of message selectors.

The Jakarta Messaging resource adapter uses these properties to create a connection factory for the message-driven bean that allows the bean to use a durable subscription.

=== Running the clientsessionmdb Example

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, deploy, and run the `simplemessage` example.

This example uses an annotation-defined topic and the preconfigured default connection factory `java:comp/DefaultJMSConnectionFactory`, so you do not have to create resources for it.

==== To Run clientsessionmdb Using NetBeans IDE

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. From the *File* menu, choose *Open Project*.

. In the *Open Project* dialog box, navigate to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/jms/clientsessionmdb
----

. Select the `clientsessionmdb` folder.

. Make sure that the *Open Required Projects* check box is selected, then click *Open Project*.

. In the *Projects* tab, right-click the `clientsessionmdb` project and select *Build*.
(If NetBeans IDE suggests that you run a priming build, click the box to do so.)
+
This command creates the following:

.. An application client JAR file that contains the client class file and the session bean's remote interface, along with a manifest file that specifies the main class and places the Jakarta Enterprise Beans JAR file in its classpath

.. An enterprise bean JAR file that contains both the session bean and the message-driven bean

.. An application EAR file that contains the two JAR files
+
The `clientsessionmdb.ear` file is created in the `clientsessionmdb-ear/target/` directory.
+
The command then deploys the EAR file, retrieves the client stubs, and runs the client.
+
The client displays these lines:
+
----
To view the bean output,
 check <install_dir>/domains/domain1/logs/server.log.
----
+

The output from the enterprise beans appears in the server log file.
The Publisher session bean sends two sets of 18 messages numbered 0 through 17.
Because of the message selector, the message-driven bean receives only the messages whose `NewsType` property is `Sports` or `Opinion`.

. Use the *Services* tab to undeploy the application after you have finished running it.

==== To Run clientsessionmdb Using Maven

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. Go to the following directory:
+
----
tut-install/examples/jms/clientsessionmdb/
----

. To compile the source files and package, deploy, and run the application, enter the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----
+
This command creates the following:

** An application client JAR file that contains the client class file and the session bean's remote interface, along with a manifest file that specifies the main class and places the enterprise bean JAR file in its classpath

** An enterprise bean JAR file that contains both the session bean and the message-driven bean

** An application EAR file that contains the two JAR files
+
The `clientsessionmdb.ear` file is created in the `clientsessionmdb-ear/target/` directory.
+
The command then deploys the EAR file, retrieves the client stubs, and runs the client.
+
The client displays these lines:
+
----
To view the bean output,
 check <install_dir>/domains/domain1/logs/server.log.
----
+
The output from the enterprise beans appears in the server log file.
The Publisher session bean sends two sets of 18 messages numbered 0 through 17.
Because of the message selector, the message-driven bean receives only the messages whose `NewsType` property is `Sports` or `Opinion`.

. Undeploy the application after you have finished running it:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn cargo:undeploy
----
