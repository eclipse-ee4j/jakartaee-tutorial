= Using Ajax with Jakarta Faces Technology

This chapter describes using Ajax functionality in Jakarta Faces web
applications. Ajax is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, a
group of web technologies that enable creation of dynamic and highly
responsive web applications. Using Ajax, web applications can retrieve
content from the server without interfering with the display on the
client. In the Jakarta EE platform, Jakarta Faces technology provides
built-in support for Ajax.
