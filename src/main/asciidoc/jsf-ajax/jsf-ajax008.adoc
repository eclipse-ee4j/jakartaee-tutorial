== Ajax Request Lifecycle

An Ajax request varies from other typical Jakarta Faces requests, and its processing is also handled differently by the Jakarta Faces lifecycle.

As described in <<partial-processing-and-partial-rendering>>, when an Ajax request is received, the state associated with that request is captured by the `jakarta.faces.context.PartialViewContext`.
This object provides access to information such as which components are targeted for processing/rendering.
The `processPartial` method of `PartialViewContext` uses this information to perform partial component tree processing and rendering.

The `execute` attribute of the `f:ajax` tag identifies which segments of the server-side component tree should be processed.
Because components can be uniquely identified in the Jakarta Faces component tree, it is easy to identify and process a single component, a few components, or a whole tree.
This is made possible by the `visitTree` method of the `UIComponent` class.
The identified components then run through the Jakarta Faces request lifecycle phases.

Similar to the `execute` attribute, the `render` attribute identifies which segments of the Jakarta Faces component tree need to be rendered during the render response phase.

During the render response phase, the `render` attribute is examined.
The identified components are found and asked to render themselves and their children.
The components are then packaged up and sent back to the client as a response.
