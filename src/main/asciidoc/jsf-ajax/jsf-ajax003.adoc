== Using Ajax with Facelets

As mentioned in the previous section, Jakarta Faces technology supports Ajax by using a built-in JavaScript resource library that is provided as part of the Jakarta Faces core libraries.
This built-in Ajax resource can be used in Jakarta Faces web applications in one of the following ways.

* By using the `f:ajax` tag along with another standard component in a Facelets application.
This method adds Ajax functionality to any UI component without additional coding and configuration.

* By using the JavaScript API method `jsf.ajax.request()` directly within the Facelets application.
This method provides direct access to Ajax methods and allows customized control of component behavior.

* By using the `<h:commandScript>` component to execute arbitrary server-side methods from a view.
The component generates a JavaScript function with a given name that when invoked, in turn invokes, a given server-side method via Ajax.

=== Using the f:ajax Tag

The `f:ajax` tag is a Jakarta Faces core tag that provides Ajax functionality to any regular UI component when used in conjunction with that component.
In the following example, Ajax behavior is added to an input component by including the `f:ajax` core tag:

[source,xml]
----
<h:inputText value="#{bean.message}">
    <f:ajax />
</h:inputText>
----

In this example, although Ajax is enabled, the other attributes of the `f:ajax` tag are not defined.
If an event is not defined, the default action for the component is performed.
For the `inputText` component, when no `event` attribute is specified, the default event is `valueChange`.
<<attributes-of-the-fajax-tag>> lists the attributes of the `f:ajax` tag and their default actions.

[width="99%",cols="15%,25%,60%"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|`disabled` |`jakarta.el.ValueExpression` that evaluates to a `Boolean` |A `Boolean` value that identifies the tag status.
A value of `true` indicates that the Ajax behavior should not be rendered.
A value of `false` indicates that the Ajax behavior should be rendered.
The default value is `false`.

|`event` |`jakarta.el.ValueExpression` that evaluates to a `String` |A `String` that identifies the type of event to which the Ajax action will apply.
If specified, it must be one of the events supported by the component.
If not specified, the default event (the event that triggers the Ajax request) is determined for the component.
The default event is `action` for `jakarta.faces.component.ActionSource` components and `valueChange` for `jakarta.faces.component.EditableValueHolder` components.

|`execute` |`jakarta.el.ValueExpression` that evaluates to an `Object` |A `Collection` that identifies a list of components to be executed on the server.
If a literal is specified, it must be a space-delimited `String` of component identifiers and/or one of the keywords.
If a `ValueExpression` is specified, it must refer to a property that returns a `Collection` of `String` objects.
If not specified, the default value is `@this`.

|`immediate` |`jakarta.el.ValueExpression` that evaluates to a `Boolean` |A `Boolean` value that indicates whether inputs are to be processed early in the lifecycle.
If `true`, behavior events generated from this behavior are broadcast during the Apply Request Values phase.
Otherwise, the events will be broadcast during the Invoke Application phase.

|`listener` |`jakarta.el.MethodExpression` |The name of the listener method that is called when a `jakarta.faces.event.AjaxBehaviorEvent` has been broadcast for the listener.

|`onevent` |`jakarta.el.ValueExpression` that evaluates to a `String` |The name of the JavaScript function that handles UI events.

|`onerror` |`jakarta.el.ValueExpression` that evaluates to a `String` |The name of the JavaScript function that handles errors.

|`render` |`jakarta.el.ValueExpression` that evaluates to an `Object` |A `Collection` that identifies a list of components to be rendered on the client.
If a literal is specified, it must be a space-delimited `String` of component identifiers and/or one of the keywords.
If a `ValueExpression` is specified, it must refer to a property that returns a `Collection` of `String` objects.
If not specified, the default value is `@none`.

The keywords listed in <<execute-and-render-keywords>> can be used with the `execute` and `render` attributes of the `f:ajax` tag.

|`@all` |All component identifiers

|`@form` |The form that encloses the component

|`@none` |No component identifiers

|`@this` |The element that triggered the request

Note that when you use the `f:ajax` tag in a Facelets page, the JavaScript resource library is loaded implicitly.
This resource library can also be loaded explicitly as described in <<loading-javascript-as-a-resource>>.
