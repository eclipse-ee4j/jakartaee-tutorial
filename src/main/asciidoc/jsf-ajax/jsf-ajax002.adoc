== Using Ajax Functionality with Jakarta Faces Technology

Ajax functionality can be added to a Jakarta Faces application in one of the following ways:

* Adding the required JavaScript code to an application

* Using the built-in Ajax resource library

In earlier releases of the Jakarta EE platform, Jakarta Faces applications provided Ajax functionality by adding the necessary JavaScript to the web page.
In the Jakarta EE platform, standard Ajax support is provided by a built-in JavaScript resource library.

With the support of this JavaScript resource library, Jakarta Faces standard UI components, such as buttons, labels, or text fields, can be enabled for Ajax functionality.
You can also load this resource library and use its methods directly from within the managed bean code.
The next sections of the tutorial describe the use of the built-in Ajax resource library.

In addition, because the Jakarta Faces technology component model can be extended, custom components can be created with Ajax functionality.

The tutorial examples include an Ajax version of the `guessnumber` application, `ajaxguessnumber`.
See <<the-ajaxguessnumber-example-application>> for more information.

The Ajax specific `f:ajax` tag and its attributes are explained in the next sections.
