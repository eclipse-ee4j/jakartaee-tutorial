== Monitoring Events on the Client

To monitor ongoing Ajax requests, use the `onevent` attribute of the `f:ajax` tag.
The value of this attribute is the name of a JavaScript function.
Jakarta Faces calls the `onevent` function at each stage of the processing of an Ajax request: begin, complete, and success.

When calling the JavaScript function assigned to the `onevent` property, Jakarta Faces passes a data object to it.
The data object contains the properties listed in <<properties-of-the-onevent-data-object>>.

[[properties-of-the-onevent-data-object]]
.Properties of the onevent Data Object
[width="60%",cols="15%,45%"]
|===
|Property |Description

|`responseXML` |The response to the Ajax call in XML format

|`responseText` |The response to the Ajax call in text format

|`responseCode` |The response to the Ajax call in numeric code

|`source` |The source of the current Ajax event: the DOM element

|`status` |The status of the current Ajax call: `begin`, `complete`, or `success`

|`type` |The type of the Ajax call: `event`
|===

By using the `status` property of the data object, you can identify the current status of the Ajax request and monitor its progress.
In the following example, `monitormyajaxevent` is a JavaScript function that monitors the Ajax request sent by the event:

[source,xml]
----
<f:ajax event="click" render="statusmessage" onevent="monitormyajaxevent"/>
----
