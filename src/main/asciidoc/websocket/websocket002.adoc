== Creating WebSocket Applications in the Jakarta EE Platform

The Jakarta EE platform includes Jakarta WebSocket,
which enables you to create, configure, and deploy WebSocket endpoints
in web applications. The WebSocket client API specified in Jakarta WebSocket also
enables you to access remote WebSocket endpoints from any Java
application.

Jakarta WebSocket consists of the following packages.

* The `javax.websocket.server` package contains annotations, classes,
and interfaces to create and configure server endpoints.
* The `javax.websocket` package contains annotations, classes,
interfaces, and exceptions that are common to client and server
endpoints.

WebSocket endpoints are instances of the `javax.websocket.Endpoint`
class. Jakarta WebSocket enables you to create two kinds of
endpoints: programmatic endpoints and annotated endpoints. To create a
programmatic endpoint, you extend the `Endpoint` class and override its
lifecycle methods. To create an annotated endpoint, you decorate a Java
class and some of its methods with the annotations provided by the
packages mentioned previously. After you have created an endpoint, you
deploy it to an specific URI in the application so that remote clients
can connect to it.

Note:

In most cases, it is easier to create and deploy an annotated endpoint
than a programmatic endpoint. This chapter provides a simple example of
a programmatic endpoint, but it focuses on annotated endpoints.

=== Creating and Deploying a WebSocket Endpoint

The process for creating and deploying a WebSocket endpoint:

1.  Create an endpoint class.
2.  Implement the lifecycle methods of the endpoint.
3.  Add your business logic to the endpoint.
4.  Deploy the endpoint inside a web application.

The process is slightly different for programmatic endpoints and
annotated endpoints, and it is covered in detail in the following
sections.

Note:

As opposed to servlets, WebSocket endpoints are instantiated multiple
times. The container creates an instance of an endpoint per connection
to its deployment URI. Each instance is associated with one and only one
connection. This facilitates keeping user state for each connection and
makes development easier, because there is only one thread executing the
code of an endpoint instance at any given time.
