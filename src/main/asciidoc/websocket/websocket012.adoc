== The websocketbot Example Application

The `websocketbot` example application, located in the `_tut-install_/examples/web/websocket/websocketbot/` directory, demonstrates how to use a WebSocket endpoint to implement a chat.
The example resembles a chat room in which many users can join and have a conversation.
Users can ask simple questions to a bot agent that is always available in the chat room.

=== Architecture of the websocketbot Example Application

The `websocketbot` example application consists of the following elements:

* <<the-cdi-bean>> – A CDI bean (`BotBean`) that contains the logic for the bot agent to reply to messages

* <<the-websocket-endpoint>> – A WebSocket endpoint (`BotEndpoint`) that implements the chat room

* <<the-application-messages>> – A set of classes (`Message`, `ChatMessage`, `InfoMessage`, `JoinMessage`, and `UsersMessage`) that represent application messages

* <<the-encoder-classes>> – A set of classes (`ChatMessageEncoder`, `InfoMessageEncoder`, `JoinMessageEncoder`, and `UsersMessageEncoder`) that encode application messages into WebSocket text messages as JSON data

* <<the-message-decoder>> – A class (`MessageDecoder`) the parses WebSocket text messages as JSON data and decodes them into `JoinMessage` or `ChatMessage` objects

* <<the-html-page-3>> – An HTML page (`index.html`) that uses JavaScript code to implement the client for the chat room

==== The CDI Bean

The CDI bean (`BotBean`) is a Java class that contains the `respond` method.
This method compares the incoming chat message with a set of predefined questions and returns a chat response.

[source,java]
----
@Named
public class BotBean {
    public String respond(String msg) { ... }
}
----

==== The WebSocket Endpoint

The WebSocket endpoint (`BotEndpoint`) is an annotated endpoint that performs the following functions:

* Receives messages from clients

* Forwards messages to clients

* Maintains a list of connected clients

* Invokes the bot agent functionality

The endpoint specifies its deployment URI and the message encoders and decoders using the `ServerEndpoint` annotation.
The endpoint obtains an instance of the `BotBean` class and a managed executor service resource through dependency injection:

[source,java]
----
@ServerEndpoint(
   value = "/websocketbot",
   decoders = { MessageDecoder.class },
   encoders = { JoinMessageEncoder.class, ChatMessageEncoder.class,
                InfoMessageEncoder.class, UsersMessageEncoder.class }
)
/* There is a BotEndpoint instance per connection */
public class BotEndpoint {
   private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("BotEndpoint");
   /* Bot functionality bean */
   @Inject private BotBean botbean;
   /* Executor service for asynchronous processing */
   @Resource(name="comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService")
   private ManagedExecutorService mes;

   @OnOpen
   public void openConnection(Session session) {
       logger.log(Level.INFO, "Connection opened.");
   }
   ...
}
----

The `message` method processes incoming messages from clients.
The decoder converts incoming text messages into `JoinMessage` or `ChatMessage` objects, which inherit from the `Message` class.
The `message` method receives a `Message` object as a parameter:

[source,java]
----
@OnMessage
public void message(Session session, Message msg) {
   logger.log(Level.INFO, "Received: {0}", msg.toString());

   if (msg instanceof JoinMessage) {
      /* Add the new user and notify everybody */
      JoinMessage jmsg = (JoinMessage) msg;
      session.getUserProperties().put("name", jmsg.getName());
      session.getUserProperties().put("active", true);
      logger.log(Level.INFO, "Received: {0}", jmsg.toString());
      sendAll(session, new InfoMessage(jmsg.getName() +
              " has joined the chat"));
      sendAll(session, new ChatMessage("Duke", jmsg.getName(),
              "Hi there!!"));
      sendAll(session, new UsersMessage(this.getUserList(session)));

   } else if (msg instanceof ChatMessage) {
      /* Forward the message to everybody */
      ChatMessage cmsg = (ChatMessage) msg;
      logger.log(Level.INFO, "Received: {0}", cmsg.toString());
      sendAll(session, cmsg);
      if (cmsg.getTarget().compareTo("Duke") == 0) {
         /* The bot replies to the message */
         mes.submit(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
               String resp = botbean.respond(cmsg.getMessage());
               sendAll(session, new ChatMessage("Duke",
                       cmsg.getName(), resp));
            }
         });
      }
   }
}
----

If the message is a join message, the endpoint adds the new user to the list and notifies all connected clients.
If the message is a chat message, the endpoint forwards it to all connected clients.

If a chat message is for the bot agent, the endpoint obtains a response using the `BotBean` instance and sends it to all connected clients.
The `sendAll` method is similar to the example in <<sending-messages-to-all-peers-connected-to-an-endpoint>>.

===== Asynchronous Processing and Concurrency Considerations

The WebSocket endpoint calls the `BotBean.respond` method to obtain a response from the bot.
In this example, this is a blocking operation; the user that sent the associated message would not be able to send or receive other chat messages until the operation completes.
To avoid this problem, the endpoint obtains an executor service from the container and executes the blocking operation in a different thread using the `ManagedExecutorService.submit` method from Concurrency Utilities for Jakarta EE.

Jakarta WebSocket specification requires that Jakarta EE implementations instantiate endpoint classes once per connection.
This facilitates the development of WebSocket endpoints, because you are guaranteed that only one thread is executing the code in a WebSocket endpoint class at any given time.
When you introduce a new thread in an endpoint, as in this example, you must ensure that variables and methods accessed by more than one thread are thread safe.
In this example, the code in `BotBean` is thread safe, and the `BotEndpoint.sendAll` method has been declared `synchronized`.

Refer to xref:jakarta-concurrency-2[xrefstyle=full] for more information on the managed executor service and Concurrency Utilities for Jakarta EE.

==== The Application Messages

The classes that represent application messages (`Message`, `ChatMessage`, `InfoMessage`, `JoinMessage`, and `UsersMessage`) contain only properties and getter and setter methods.
For example, the `ChatMessage` class looks like this:

[source,java]
----
public class ChatMessage extends Message {
    private String name;
    private String target;
    private String message;
    /* ... Constructor, getters, and setters ... */
}
----

==== The Encoder Classes

The encoder classes convert application message objects into JSON text using the Java API for JSON Processing.
For example, the `ChatMessageEncoder` class is implemented as follows:

[source,java]
----
/* Encode a ChatMessage as JSON.
 * For example, (new ChatMessage("Peter","Duke","How are you?"))
 * is encoded as follows:
 * {"type":"chat","target":"Duke","message":"How are you?"}
 */
public class ChatMessageEncoder implements Encoder.Text<ChatMessage> {
   @Override
   public void init(EndpointConfig ec) { }
   @Override
   public void destroy() { }
   @Override
   public String encode(ChatMessage chatMessage) throws EncodeException {
      // Access properties in chatMessage and write JSON text...
   }
}
----

See xref:json-processing[xrefstyle=full] for more information on the Jakarta JSON Processing.

==== The Message Decoder

The message decoder (`MessageDecoder`) class converts WebSocket text messages into application messages by parsing JSON text.
It is implemented as follows:

[source,java]
----
/* Decode a JSON message into a JoinMessage or a ChatMessage.
 * For example, the incoming message
 * {"type":"chat","name":"Peter","target":"Duke","message":"How are you?"}
 * is decoded as (new ChatMessage("Peter", "Duke", "How are you?"))
 */
public class MessageDecoder implements Decoder.Text<Message> {
    /* Stores the name-value pairs from a JSON message as a Map */
    private Map<String,String> messageMap;

    @Override
    public void init(EndpointConfig ec) { }
    @Override
    public void destroy() { }

    /* Create a new Message object if the message can be decoded */
    @Override
    public Message decode(String string) throws DecodeException {
       Message msg = null;
       if (willDecode(string)) {
          switch (messageMap.get("type")) {
             case "join":
                msg = new JoinMessage(messageMap.get("name"));
                break;
             case "chat":
                msg = new ChatMessage(messageMap.get("name"),
                                      messageMap.get("target"),
                                      messageMap.get("message"));
          }
       } else {
          throw new DecodeException(string, "[Message] Can't decode.");
       }
       return msg;
   }

   /* Decode a JSON message into a Map and check if it contains
    * all the required fields according to its type. */
   @Override
   public boolean willDecode(String string) {
      // Convert JSON data from the message into a name-value map...
      // Check if the message has all the fields for its message type...
   }
}
----

==== The HTML Page

The HTML page (`index.html`) contains a field for the user name.
After the user types a name and clicks Join, three text areas are available: one to type and send messages, one for the chat room, and one with the list of users.
The page also contains a WebSocket console that shows the messages sent and received as JSON text.

The JavaScript code on the page uses the WebSocket API to connect to the endpoint, send messages, and designate callback methods.
The WebSocket API is supported by most modern browsers and is widely used for web client development with HTML5.
