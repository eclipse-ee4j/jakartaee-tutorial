== The jsonpstreaming Example Application

This section describes how to build and run the `jsonpstreaming` example application.
This example is a web application that demonstrates how to create JSON data from form data, how to parse JSON data, and how to write JSON output using the streaming API.

The `jsonpstreaming` example application is in the `_tut-install_/examples/web/jsonp/jsonpstreaming` directory.

=== Components of the jsonpstreaming Example Application

The `jsonpstreaming` example application contains the following files.

* Three Jakarta Faces pages.

** The `index.xhtml` page contains a form to collect information.

** The `filewritten.xhtml` page contains a text area that displays JSON data.

** The `parsed.xhtml` page contains a table that lists the events from the parser.

* The `StreamingBean.java` managed bean, a session-scoped managed bean that stores the data from the form and directs the navigation between the Facelets pages.
This file also contains code that uses the JSON streaming API.

The code used in `StreamingBean.java` to write JSON data to a file is similar to the example in <<writing-json-data-using-a-generator>>.
The code to parse JSON data from a file is similar to the example in <<reading-json-data-using-a-parser>>.

=== Running the jsonpstreaming Example Application

This section describes how to run the `jsonpstreaming` example application using NetBeans IDE and from the command line.

==== To Run the jsonpstreaming Example Application Using NetBeans IDE

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. From the *File* menu, choose *Open Project*.

.  In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/web/jsonp
----

. Select the `jsonpstreaming` folder.

. Click *Open Project*.

. In the *Projects* tab, right-click the `jsonpstreaming` project and select *Run*.
+
This command builds and packages the application into a WAR file (`jsonpstreaming.war`) located in the `target` directory, deploys it to the server, and opens a web browser window with the following URL:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/jsonpstreaming/
----

. Edit the data on the page and click Write a JSON Object to a File to submit the form and write a JSON object to a text file.
The following page shows the contents of the text file.

. Click Parse JSON from File.
The following page contains a table that lists the parser events for the JSON data in the text file.
