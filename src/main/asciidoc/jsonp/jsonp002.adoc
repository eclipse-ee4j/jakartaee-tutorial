== JSON Processing in the Jakarta EE Platform

Jakarta EE includes support for the Jakarta JSON Processing spec, which provides an API to parse,
transform, and query JSON data using the object model or the streaming
model described in link:#BABJJACI[Generating and Parsing
JSON Data]. Jakarta JSON Processing contains the following
packages:

* The `jakarta.json` package contains a reader interface, a writer
interface, a model builder interface for the object model, and utility
classes and Java types for JSON elements. This package also includes
several classes that implement other JSON-related standards: link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901[JSON Pointer],
link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902[JSON Patch], and link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396[JSON Merge Patch].
These standards are used to retrieve, transform or manipulate values
in an object model. link:#CHDJJCBE[Table 20-1] lists the main classes
and interfaces in this package.
* The `jakarta.json.stream` package contains a parser interface and a
generator interface for the streaming model. link:#CHDIHCEG[Table 20-2]
lists the main classes and interfaces in this package.
* The `jakarta.json.spi` package contains a Service Provider Interface (SPI)
to plug in implementations for JSON processing objects. This package
contains the `JsonProvider` class, which contains the methods that a service
provider implements.

[width=99%,cols="25%,75%"]
|=======================================================================
|*Class or Interface* |*Description*
|`Json` |Contains static methods to create instances of JSON parsers,
builders, and generators. This class also contains methods to create
parser, builder, and generator factory objects.

|`JsonReader` | Reads JSON data from a stream and creates an object model
in memory.

|`JsonObjectBuilder`, `JsonArrayBuilder` | Create an object model or an array model in memory by adding elements
from application code.

|`JsonWriter` | Writes an object model from memory to a stream.

|`JsonValue` | Represents an element (such as an object, an array, or a
value) in JSON data.

|`JsonStructure` | Represents an object or an array in JSON data. This
interface is a subtype of `JsonValue`.

|`JsonObject`, `JsonArray` | Represent an object or an array in JSON data. These two interfaces are
subtypes of `JsonStructure`.

|`JsonPointer` | Contains methods for operating on specific targets within JSON documents. The targets can be `JsonValue`,
`JsonObject`, or `JsonArray` objects.

|`JsonPatch` | An interface for supporting a sequence of operations to be applied to a target JSON resource. The
operations are defined within a JSON patch document.

|`JsonMergePatch` | An interface for supporting updates to target JSON resources. A JSON patch document is compared with
the target resource to determine the specific set of change operations to be applied.

|`JsonString`, `JsonNumber` | Represent data types for elements in JSON data. These two interfaces
are subtypes of `JsonValue`.

|`JsonException` | Indicates that a problem occurred during JSON
processing.

|=======================================================================
|*Class or Interface* |*Description*
|`JsonParser` | Represents an event-based parser that can read JSON data
from a stream or from an object model.

|`JsonGenerator` | Writes JSON data to a stream one element at a time.
