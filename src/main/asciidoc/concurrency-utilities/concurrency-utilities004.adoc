== Concurrency and Security

Jakarta Concurrency defers most security decisions to the application server implementation.
If, however, the container supports a security context, that context can be propagated to the thread of execution.
The `ContextService` can support several runtime behaviors, and the `security` attribute, if enabled, will propagate the container security principal.
