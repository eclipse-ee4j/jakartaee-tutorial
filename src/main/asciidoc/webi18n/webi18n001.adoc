== Java Platform Localization Classes

In the Java platform, `java.util.Locale` (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html[^]) represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural region.
The string representation of a locale consists of the international standard two-character abbreviation for language and country and an optional variant, all separated by underscore (`_`) characters.
Examples of locale strings include `fr` (French), `de_CH` (Swiss German), and `en_US_POSIX` (English on a POSIX-compliant platform).

Locale-sensitive data is stored in a `java.util.ResourceBundle` (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html[^]).
A resource bundle contains key-value pairs, where the keys uniquely identify a locale-specific object in the bundle.
A resource bundle can be backed by a text file (properties resource bundle) or a class (list resource bundle) containing the pairs.
You construct a resource bundle instance by appending a locale string representation to a base name.

The Duke's Bookstore application (see xref:dukes-bookstore-case-study-example[xrefstyle=full]) contains resource bundles with the base name `messages.properties` for the locales `de` (German), `es` (Spanish), and `fr` (French).
The default locale, `en` (English), which is specified in the `faces-config.xml` file, uses the resource bundle with the base name, `messages.properties`.
