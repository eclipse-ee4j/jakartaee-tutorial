== A Web Module That Uses Jakarta Servlet Technology: The hello2 Example

The `hello2` application is a web module that uses Jakarta Servlet technology to display a greeting and response.
You can use a text editor to view the application files, or you can use NetBeans IDE.

The source code for this application is in the `_tut-install_/examples/web/servlet/hello2/` directory.

=== Mapping URLs to Web Components

When it receives a request, the web container must determine which web component should handle the request.
The web container does so by mapping the URL path contained in the request to a web application and a web component.
A URL path contains the context root and, optionally, a URL pattern:

----
http://host:port/context-root[/url-pattern]
----

You set the URL pattern for a servlet by using the `@WebServlet` annotation in the servlet source file.
For example, the `GreetingServlet.java` file in the `hello2` application contains the following annotation, specifying the URL pattern as `/greeting`:

[source,java]
----
@WebServlet("/greeting")
public class GreetingServlet extends HttpServlet {
    ...
}
----

This annotation indicates that the URL pattern `/greeting` follows the context root.
Therefore, when the servlet is deployed locally, it is accessed with the following URL:

----
http://localhost:8080/hello2/greeting
----

To access the servlet by using only the context root, specify `"/"` as the URL pattern.

=== Examining the hello2 Web Module

The `hello2` application behaves almost identically to the `hello1` application, but it is implemented using Jakarta Servlet technology instead of Jakarta Faces technology.
You can use a text editor to view the application files, or you can use NetBeans IDE.

==== To View the hello2 Web Module Using NetBeans IDE

To view the `hello2` web module using NetBeans IDE:

. From the *File* menu, choose *Open Project*.

. In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/web/servlet
----

. Select the `hello2` folder and click *Open Project*.

. Expand the *Source Packages* node, then expand the `ee.jakarta.tutorial.hello2` node.

. Double-click the `GreetingServlet.java` file to view it.
+
This servlet overrides the `doGet` method, implementing the `GET` method of HTTP.
The servlet displays a simple HTML greeting form whose Submit button, like that of `hello1`, specifies a response page for its action.
The following excerpt begins with the `@WebServlet` annotation, which specifies the URL pattern relative to the context root:
+
[source,java]
----
@WebServlet("/greeting")
public class GreetingServlet extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {

        response.setContentType("text/html");
        response.setBufferSize(8192);
        try (PrintWriter out = response.getWriter()) {
            out.println("<html lang=\"en\">"
                    + "<head><title>Servlet Hello</title></head>");

            // then write the data of the response
            out.println("<body  bgcolor=\"#ffffff\">"
                + "<img src=\"duke.waving.gif\" "
                + "alt=\"Duke waving his hand\">"
                + "<form method=\"get\">"
                + "<h2>Hello, my name is Duke. What's yours?</h2>"
                + "<input title=\"My name is: \"type=\"text\" "
                + "name=\"username\" size=\"25\">"
                + "<p></p>"
                + "<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">"
                + "<input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\">"
                + "</form>");

            String username = request.getParameter("username");
            if (username != null && username.length() > 0) {
                RequestDispatcher dispatcher =
                    getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/response");

                if (dispatcher != null) {
                    dispatcher.include(request, response);
                }
            }
            out.println("</body></html>");
        }
    }
    ...
}
----

. Double-click the `ResponseServlet.java` file to view it.
+
This servlet also overrides the `doGet` method, displaying only the response.
The following excerpt begins with the `@WebServlet` annotation, which specifies the URL pattern relative to the context root:
+
[source,java]
----
@WebServlet("/response")
public class ResponseServlet extends HttpServlet {

    @Override
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        try (PrintWriter out = response.getWriter()) {

            // then write the data of the response
            String username = request.getParameter("username");
            if (username != null && username.length() > 0) {
                out.println("<h2>Hello, " + username + "!</h2>");
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
----

=== Running the hello2 Example

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, package, deploy, and run the `hello2` example.

==== To Run the hello2 Example Using NetBeans IDE

To run the `hello2` example using NetBeans IDE:

. Start GlassFish Server as described in <<to-start-glassfish-server-using-netbeans-ide>>, if you have not already done so.

. From the *File* menu, choose *Open Project*.

. In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/web/servlet
----

. Select the `hello2` folder.

. Click *Open Project*.

. In the *Projects* tab, right-click the `hello2` project and select *Build* to package and deploy the project.

. In a web browser, open the following URL:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/hello2/greeting
----
+
The URL specifies the context root, followed by the URL pattern.
+
The application looks much like the `hello1` application.
The major difference is that after you click Submit the response appears below the greeting, not on a separate page.

==== To Run the hello2 Example Using Maven

To run the `hello2` example using Maven:

. Start GlassFish Server as described in <<to-start-glassfish-server-using-the-command-line>>, if you have not already done so.

. In a terminal window, go to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/web/servlet/hello2/
----

. Enter the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----
+
This target builds the WAR file, copies it to the `_tut-install_/examples/web/hello2/target/` directory, and deploys it.

. In a web browser, open the following URL:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/hello2/greeting
----
+
The URL specifies the context root, followed by the URL pattern.
+
The application looks much like the `hello1` application.
The major difference is that after you click Submit the response appears below the greeting, not on a separate page.
