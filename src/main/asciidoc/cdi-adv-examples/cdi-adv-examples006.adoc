== The decorators Example: Decorating a Bean

The `decorators` example, which is yet another variation on the `encoder` example, shows how to use a decorator to implement additional business logic for a bean.

The source files are located in the `_tut-install_/examples/cdi/decorators/src/main/java/ee/jakarta/tutorial/decorators/` directory.

=== Overview of the decorators Example

Instead of having the user choose between two alternative implementations of an interface at deployment time or runtime, a decorator adds some additional logic to a single implementation of the interface.

The example includes an interface, an implementation of it, a decorator, an interceptor, a managed bean, a Facelets page, and configuration files.

=== Components of the decorators Example

The `decorators` example is very similar to the `encoder` example described in <<the-encoder-example-using-alternatives>>.
Instead of providing two implementations of the `Coder` interface, however, this example provides only the `CoderImpl` class.
The decorator class, `CoderDecorator`, rather than simply return the coded string, displays the input and output strings' values and length.

The `CoderDecorator` class, like `CoderImpl`, implements the business method of the `Coder` interface, `codeString`:

[source,java]
----
@Decorator
public abstract class CoderDecorator implements Coder {

    @Inject
    @Delegate
    @Any
    Coder coder;

    public String codeString(String s, int tval) {
        int len = s.length();

        return "\"" + s + "\" becomes " + "\"" + coder.codeString(s, tval)
                + "\", " + len + " characters in length";
    }
}
----

The decorator's `codeString` method calls the delegate object's `codeString` method to perform the actual encoding.

The `decorators` example includes the `Logged` interceptor binding and `LoggedInterceptor` class from the `billpayment` example.
For this example, the interceptor is set on the `CoderBean.encodeString` method and the `CoderImpl.codeString` method.
The interceptor code is unchanged; interceptors are usually reusable for different applications.

Except for the interceptor annotations, the `CoderBean` and `CoderImpl` classes are identical to the versions in the `encoder` example.

The `beans.xml` file specifies both the decorator and the interceptor:

[source,xml]
----
<decorators>
    <class>ee.jakarta.tutorial.decorators.CoderDecorator</class>
</decorators>
<interceptors>
    <class>ee.jakarta.tutorial.decorators.LoggedInterceptor</class>
</interceptors>
----

=== Running the decorators Example

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, package, deploy, and run the `decorators` application.

==== To Build, Package, and Deploy the decorators Example Using NetBeans IDE

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. From the *File* menu, choose *Open Project*.

. In the *Open Project* dialog box, navigate to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/cdi
----

. Select the `decorators` folder.

. Click *Open Project*.

. In the *Projects* tab, right-click the `decorators` project and select *Build*.
+
This command builds and packages the application into a WAR file, `decorators.war`, located in the `target` directory, and then deploys it to GlassFish Server.

==== To Build, Package, and Deploy the decorators Example Using Maven

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. In a terminal window, go to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/cdi/decorators/
----

. Enter the following command to deploy the application:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----
+
This command builds and packages the application into a WAR file, `decorators.war`, located in the `target` directory, and then deploys it to GlassFish Server.

==== To Run the decorators Example

. In a web browser, enter the following URL:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/decorators
----

. On the Decorated String Encoder page, enter a string and the number of letters to shift by, and then click Encode.
+
The output from the decorator method appears in blue on the Result line.
For example, if you entered `Java` and `4`, you would see the following:
+
----
"Java" becomes "Neze", 4 characters in length
----

. Examine the server log output.
+
In NetBeans IDE, the output is visible in the GlassFish Server Output tab.
Otherwise, view `_domain-dir_/logs/server.log`.
+
The output from the interceptors appears:
+
----
INFO: Entering method: encodeString in class ee.jakarta.tutorial.decorators.CoderBean
INFO: Entering method: codeString in class ee.jakarta.tutorial.decorators.CoderImpl
----
