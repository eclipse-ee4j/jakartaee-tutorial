== The billpayment Example: Using Events and Interceptors

The `billpayment` example shows how to use both events and interceptors.

The source files are located in the `_tut-install_/examples/cdi/billpayment/src/main/java/ee/jakarta/tutorial/billpayment/` directory.

=== Overview of the billpayment Example

The example simulates paying an amount using a debit card or credit card.
When the user chooses a payment method, the managed bean creates an appropriate event, supplies its payload, and fires it.
A simple event listener handles the event using observer methods.

The example also defines an interceptor that is set on a class and on two methods of another class.

=== The PaymentEvent Event Class

The event class, `event.PaymentEvent`, is a simple bean class that contains a no-argument constructor.
It also has a `toString` method and getter and setter methods for the payload components: a `String` for the payment type, a `BigDecimal` for the payment amount, and a `Date` for the timestamp.

[source,java]
----
public class PaymentEvent implements Serializable {

    ...
    public String paymentType;
    public BigDecimal value;
    public Date datetime;

    public PaymentEvent() {
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.paymentType
                + " = $" + this.value.toString()
                + " at " + this.datetime.toString();
    }
    ...
}
----

The event class is a simple bean that is instantiated by the managed bean using `new` and then populated.
For this reason, the CDI container cannot intercept the creation of the bean, and hence it cannot allow interception of its getter and setter methods.

=== The PaymentHandler Event Listener

The event listener, `listener.PaymentHandler`, contains two observer methods, one for each of the two event types:

[source,java]
----
@Logged
@SessionScoped
public class PaymentHandler implements Serializable {

    ...
    public void creditPayment(@Observes @Credit PaymentEvent event) {
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "PaymentHandler - Credit Handler: {0}",
                event.toString());

        // call a specific Credit handler class...
    }

    public void debitPayment(@Observes @Debit PaymentEvent event) {
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "PaymentHandler - Debit Handler: {0}",
                event.toString());

        // call a specific Debit handler class...
    }
}
----

Each observer method takes as an argument the event, annotated with `@Observes` and with the qualifier for the type of payment.
In a real application, the observer methods would pass the event information on to another component that would perform business logic on the payment.

The qualifiers are defined in the `payment` package, described in <<the-billpayment-facelets-pages-and-managed-bean>>.

The `PaymentHandler` bean is annotated `@Logged` so that all its methods can be intercepted.

=== The billpayment Facelets Pages and Managed Bean

The `billpayment` example contains two Facelets pages, `index.xhtml` and the very simple `response.xhtml`.
The body of `index.xhtml` looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
    <h:body>
        <h3>Bill Payment Options</h3>
        <p>Enter an amount, select Debit Card or Credit Card,
            then click Pay.</p>
        <h:form>
            <p>
            <h:outputLabel value="Amount: $" for="amt"/>
            <h:inputText id="amt" value="#{paymentBean.value}"
                         required="true"
                         requiredMessage="An amount is required."
                         maxlength="15" />
            </p>
            <h:outputLabel value="Options:" for="opt"/>
            <h:selectOneRadio id="opt" value="#{paymentBean.paymentOption}">
                <f:selectItem id="debit" itemLabel="Debit Card"
                              itemValue="1"/>
                <f:selectItem id="credit" itemLabel="Credit Card"
                              itemValue="2" />
            </h:selectOneRadio>
            <p><h:commandButton id="submit" value="Pay"
                                action="#{paymentBean.pay}" /></p>
            <p><h:commandButton value="Reset"
                                action="#{paymentBean.reset}" /></p>
        </h:form>
        ...
    </h:body>
----

The input field takes a payment amount, passed to `paymentBean.value`.
Two options ask the user to select a Debit Card or Credit Card payment, passing the integer value to `paymentBean.paymentOption`.
Finally, the Pay command button's action is set to the method `paymentBean.pay`, and the Reset button's action is set to the `paymentBean.reset` method.

The `payment.PaymentBean` managed bean uses qualifiers to differentiate between the two kinds of payment event:

[source,java]
----
@Named
@SessionScoped
public class PaymentBean implements Serializable {

   ...
    @Inject
    @Credit
    Event<PaymentEvent> creditEvent;

    @Inject
    @Debit
    Event<PaymentEvent> debitEvent;
    ...
}
----

The qualifiers, `@Credit` and `@Debit`, are defined in the `payment` package along with `PaymentBean`.

Next, the `PaymentBean` defines the properties it obtains from the Facelets page and will pass on to the event:

[source,java]
----
public static final int DEBIT = 1;
public static final int CREDIT = 2;
private int paymentOption = DEBIT;

@Digits(integer = 10, fraction = 2, message = "Invalid value")
private BigDecimal value;

private Date datetime;
----

The `paymentOption` value is an integer passed in from the option component; the default value is `DEBIT`.
The `value` is a `BigDecimal` with a Bean Validation constraint that enforces a currency value with a maximum number of digits.
The timestamp for the event, `datetime`, is a `Date` object initialized when the `pay` method is called.

The `pay` method of the bean first sets the timestamp for this payment event.
It then creates and populates the event payload, using the constructor for the `PaymentEvent` and calling the event's setter methods, using the bean properties as arguments.
It then fires the event.

[source,java]
----
@Logged
public String pay() {
    this.setDatetime(Calendar.getInstance().getTime());
    switch (paymentOption) {
        case DEBIT:
            PaymentEvent debitPayload = new PaymentEvent();
            debitPayload.setPaymentType("Debit");
            debitPayload.setValue(value);
            debitPayload.setDatetime(datetime);
            debitEvent.fire(debitPayload);
            break;
        case CREDIT:
            PaymentEvent creditPayload = new PaymentEvent();
            creditPayload.setPaymentType("Credit");
            creditPayload.setValue(value);
            creditPayload.setDatetime(datetime);
            creditEvent.fire(creditPayload);
            break;
        default:
            logger.severe("Invalid payment option!");
    }
    return "response";
}
----

The `pay` method returns the page to which the action is redirected, `response.xhtml`.

The `PaymentBean` class also contains a `reset` method that empties the value field on the `index.xhtml` page and sets the payment option to the default:

[source,java]
----
@Logged
public void reset() {
    setPaymentOption(DEBIT);
    setValue(BigDecimal.ZERO);
}
----

In this bean, only the `pay` and `reset` methods are intercepted.

The `response.xhtml` page displays the amount paid.
It uses a `rendered` expression to display the payment method:

[source,xml]
----
    <h:body>
        <h:form>
            <h2>Bill Payment: Result</h2>
            <h3>Amount Paid with
                <h:outputText id="debit" value="Debit Card: "
                              rendered="#{paymentBean.paymentOption eq 1}" />
                <h:outputText id="credit" value="Credit Card: "
                              rendered="#{paymentBean.paymentOption eq 2}" />
                <h:outputText id="result" value="#{paymentBean.value}">
                    <f:convertNumber type="currency"/>
                </h:outputText>
            </h3>
            <p><h:commandButton id="back" value="Back" action="index" /></p>
        </h:form>
    </h:body>
----

=== The LoggedInterceptor Interceptor Class

The interceptor class, `LoggedInterceptor`, and its interceptor binding, `Logged`, are both defined in the `interceptor` package.
The `Logged` interceptor binding is defined as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Inherited
@InterceptorBinding
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target({METHOD, TYPE})
public @interface Logged {
}
----

The `LoggedInterceptor` class looks like this:

[source,java]
----
@Logged
@Interceptor
public class LoggedInterceptor implements Serializable {

    ...

    public LoggedInterceptor() {
    }

    @AroundInvoke
    public Object logMethodEntry(InvocationContext invocationContext)
            throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Entering method: "
                + invocationContext.getMethod().getName() + " in class "
                + invocationContext.getMethod().getDeclaringClass().getName());

        return invocationContext.proceed();
    }
}
----

The class is annotated with both the `@Logged` and the `@Interceptor` annotations.
The `@AroundInvoke` method, `logMethodEntry`, takes the required `InvocationContext` argument and calls the required `proceed` method.
When a method is intercepted, `logMethodEntry` displays the name of the method being invoked as well as its class.

To enable the interceptor, the `beans.xml` file defines it as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<interceptors>
    <class>ee.jakarta.tutorial.billpayment.interceptor.LoggedInterceptor</class>
</interceptors>
----

In this application, the `PaymentEvent` and `PaymentHandler` classes are annotated `@Logged`, so all their methods are intercepted.
In `PaymentBean`, only the `pay` and `reset` methods are annotated `@Logged`, so only those methods are intercepted.

=== Running the billpayment Example

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, package, deploy, and run the `billpayment` application.

==== To Build, Package, and Deploy the billpayment Example Using NetBeans IDE

This command builds and packages the application into a WAR file, `billpayment.war`, located in the `target` directory, and then deploys it to GlassFish Server.

==== To Run the billpayment Example

. In a web browser, enter the following URL:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/billpayment
----

. On the Bill Payment Options page, enter a value in the Amount field.
+
The amount can contain up to 10 digits and include up to two decimal places.
For example:
+
----
9876.54
----

. Select Debit Card or Credit Card and click Pay.
+
The Bill Payment: Result page opens, displaying the amount paid and the method of payment:
+
----
Amount Paid with Credit Card: $9,876.34
----
