== Registering a Custom Component

In addition to registering custom renderers (as explained in the preceding section), you also must register the custom components that are usually associated with the custom renderers.
You use either a `@FacesComponent` annotation, as described in <<creating-custom-component-classes>>, or the `component` element of the application configuration resource file.

Here is a hypothetical `component` element from the application configuration resource file that registers `AreaComponent`:

[source,xml]
----
<component>
    <component-type>DemoArea</component-type>
    <component-class>
        dukesbookstore.components.AreaComponent
    </component-class>
    <property>
        <property-name>alt</property-name>
        <property-class>java.lang.String</property-class>
    </property>
    <property>
        <property-name>coords</property-name>
        <property-class>java.lang.String</property-class>
    </property>
    <property>
        <property-name>shape</property-name>
        <property-class>java.lang.String</property-class>
    </property>
</component>
----

Attributes specified in a `component` tag override any settings in the `@FacesComponent` annotation.

The `component-type` element indicates the name under which the component should be registered.
Other objects referring to this component use this name.
For example, the `component-type` element in the configuration for `AreaComponent` defines a value of `DemoArea`, which matches the value returned by the `AreaTag` class's `getComponentType` method.

The `component-class` element indicates the fully qualified class name of the component.
The `property` elements specify the component properties and their types.

If the custom component can include facets, you can configure the facets in the component configuration using `facet` elements, which are allowed after the `component-class` elements.
See <<registering-a-custom-renderer-with-a-render-kit>> for further details on configuring facets.
