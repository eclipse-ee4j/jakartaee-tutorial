== Registering a Custom Converter

As is the case with a custom validator, if the application developer creates a custom converter, you must register it with the application either by using the `@FacesConverter` annotation, as described in <<creating-a-custom-converter>>, or by using the `converter` XML element in the application configuration resource file.
Here is a hypothetical `converter` configuration for `CreditCardConverter` from the Duke's Bookstore case study:

[source,xml]
----
<converter>
    <description>
        Converter for credit card numbers that normalizes
        the input to a standard format
    </description>
    <converter-id>CreditCardConverter</converter-id>
    <converter-class>
        dukesbookstore.converters.CreditCardConverter
    </converter-class>
</converter>
----

Attributes specified in a `converter` tag override any settings in the `@FacesConverter` annotation.

The `converter` element represents a `jakarta.faces.convert.Converter` implementation and contains required `converter-id` and `converter-class` elements.

The `converter-id` element identifies an ID that is used by the `converter` attribute of a UI component tag to apply the converter to the component's data.
<<using-a-custom-converter>> includes an example of referencing the custom converter from a component tag.

The `converter-class` element identifies the `Converter` implementation.

<<creating-and-using-a-custom-converter>> explains how to create a custom converter.
