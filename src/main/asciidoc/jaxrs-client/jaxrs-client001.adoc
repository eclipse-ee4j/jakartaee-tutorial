== Overview of the Client API

The Jakarta REST Client API provides a high-level API for accessing any REST resources, not just Jakarta REST services.
The Client API is defined in the `jakarta.ws.rs.client` package.

=== Creating a Basic Client Request Using the Client API

The following steps are needed to access a REST resource using the Client API.

. Obtain an instance of the `jakarta.ws.rs.client.Client` interface.

. Configure the `Client` instance with a target.

. Create a request based on the target.

. Invoke the request.

The Client API is designed to be fluent, with method invocations chained together to configure and submit a request to a REST resource in only a few lines of code.

[source,java]
----
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
String name = client.target("http://example.com/webapi/hello")
        .request(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
        .get(String.class);
----

In this example, the client instance is first created by calling the `jakarta.ws.rs.client.ClientBuilder.newClient` method.
Then, the request is configured and invoked by chaining method calls together in one line of code.
The `Client.target` method sets the target based on a URI.
The `jakarta.ws.rs.client.WebTarget.request` method sets the media type for the returned entity.
The `jakarta.ws.rs.client.Invocation.Builder.get` method invokes the service using an HTTP `GET` request, setting the type of the returned entity to `String`.

=== Obtaining the Client Instance

The `Client` interface defines the actions and infrastructure a REST client requires to consume a RESTful web service.
Instances of `Client` are obtained by calling the `ClientBuilder.newClient` method.

[source,java]
----
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
----

Use the `close` method to close `Client` instances after all the invocations for the target resource have been performed:

[source,java]
----
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
...
client.close();
----

`Client` instances are heavyweight objects.
For performance reasons, limit the number of `Client` instances in your application, as the initialization and destruction of these instances may be expensive in your runtime environment.

=== Setting the Client Target

The target of a client, the REST resource at a particular URI, is represented by an instance of the `jakarta.ws.rs.client.WebTarget` interface.
You obtain a `WebTarget` instance by calling the `Client.target` method and passing in the URI of the target REST resource.

[source,java]
----
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
WebTarget myResource = client.target("http://example.com/webapi");
----

For complex REST resources, it may be beneficial to create several instances of `WebTarget`.
In the following example, a base target is used to construct several other targets that represent different services provided by a REST resource.

[source,java]
----
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
WebTarget base = client.target("http://example.com/webapi");
// WebTarget at http://example.com/webapi/read
WebTarget read = base.path("read");
// WebTarget at http://example.com/webapi/write
WebTarget write = base.path("write");
----

The `WebTarget.path` method creates a new `WebTarget` instance by appending the current target URI with the path that was passed in.

=== Setting Path Parameters in Targets

Path parameters in client requests can be specified as URI template parameters, similar to the template parameters used when defining a resource URI in a Jakarta REST service.
Template parameters are specified by surrounding the template variable with braces (`{}`).
Call the `resolveTemplate` method to substitute the `{username}`, and then call the `queryParam` method to add another variable to pass.

[source,java]
----
WebTarget myResource = client.target("http://example.com/webapi/read")
        .path("{userName}")
        .resolveTemplate("userName", "janedoe")        
        .queryParam("chapter", "1");
// http://example.com/webapi/read/janedoe?chapter=1
Response response = myResource.request(...).get();
----

=== Invoking the Request

After setting and applying any configuration options to the target, call one of the `WebTarget.request` methods to begin creating the request.
This is usually accomplished by passing to `WebTarget.request` the accepted media response type for the request either as a string of the MIME type or using one of the constants in `jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType`.
The `WebTarget.request` method returns an instance of `jakarta.ws.rs.client.Invocation.Builder`, a helper object that provides methods for preparing the client request.

[source,java]
----
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
WebTarget myResource = client.target("http://example.com/webapi/read");
Invocation.Builder builder = myResource.request(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN);
----

Using a `MediaType` constant is equivalent to using the string defining the MIME type.

[source,java]
----
Invocation.Builder builder = myResource.request("text/plain");
----

After setting the media type, invoke the request by calling one of the methods of the `Invocation.Builder` instance that corresponds to the type of HTTP request the target REST resource expects.
These methods are:

* `get()`

* `post()`

* `delete()`

* `put()`

* `head()`

* `options()`

For example, if the target REST resource is for an HTTP GET request, call the `Invocation.Builder.get` method.
The return type should correspond to the entity returned by the target REST resource.

[source,java]
----
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
WebTarget myResource = client.target("http://example.com/webapi/read");
String response = myResource.request(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
        .get(String.class);
----

If the target REST resource is expecting an HTTP POST request, call the `Invocation.Builder.post` method.

[source,java]
----
Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();
StoreOrder order = new StoreOrder(...);
WebTarget myResource = client.target("http://example.com/webapi/write");
TrackingNumber trackingNumber = myResource.request(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
                                   .post(Entity.xml(order), TrackingNumber.class);
----

In the preceding example, the return type is a custom class and is retrieved by setting the type in the `Invocation.Builder.post(Entity<?> entity, Class<T> responseType)` method as a parameter.

If the return type is a collection, use `jakarta.ws.rs.core.GenericType<T>` as the response type parameter, where `T` is the collection type:

[source,java]
----
List<StoreOrder> orders = client.target("http://example.com/webapi/read")
        .path("allOrders")
        .request(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
        .get(new GenericType<List<StoreOrder>>() {});
----

This preceding example shows how methods are chained together in the Client API to simplify how requests are configured and invoked.
