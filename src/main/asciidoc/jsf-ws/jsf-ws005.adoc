== Conditionally Connecting WebSockets

You can use the optional connected attribute to control whether to auto-reconnect the WebSocket.

[source,xml]
----
<f:websocket ... connected="#{bean.pushable}" />
----

The connected attribute defaults to `true` and is interpreted as a JavaScript instruction to open or close the WebSocket push connection.
If the value is an EL expression and it becomes `false` during an ajax request, then the push connection will explicitly be closed during `oncomplete` of that ajax request.

You can also explicitly set it to `false` and manually open the push connection on the client side by invoking `jsf.push.open(clientId)`, passing the component's client ID.

[source,xml]
----
<h:commandButton ... onclick="jsf.push.open('foo')">
    <f:ajax ... />
</h:commandButton>
<f:websocket id="foo" channel="bar" scope="view" ... connected="false" />
----

If you intend to have a one-time push and do not expect more messages, you can optionally explicitly close the push connection from the client side by invoking `jsf.push.close(clientId)`, passing the component's client ID.
For example, in the `onmessage` JavaScript listener function, as seen below:

[source,javascript]
----
function someWebsocketListener(message) {
// ... jsf.push.close('foo');
}
----

=== WebSocket Events: Server

When a session or view-scoped socket is automatically closed with close reason code `1000` by the server (and thus, not manually closed by the client via `jsf.push.close(clientId)`), it means that the session or view has expired.

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class WebsocketObserver {

    public void onOpen(@Observes @Opened WebsocketEvent event) {
        String channel = event.getChannel();
        // Returns <f:websocket channel>. Long userId = event.getUser();
        // Returns <f:websocket user>, if any.
        // ...
    }

    public void onClose(@Observes @Closed WebsocketEvent event) { String channel = event.getChannel();
        // Returns <f:websocket channel>. Long userId = event.getUser();
        // Returns <f:websocket user>, if any. CloseCode code = event.getCloseCode();
        // Returns close reason code.
       // ...
    }
}
----

=== WebSocket Events: Clients

You can use the optional `onopen` JavaScript listener function to listen for the open of a WebSocket on the client side.
This function is invoked on the very first connection attempt, regardless of whether it will be successful.
It will not be invoked when the WebSocket auto-reconnects a broken connection after the first successful connection.

[source,javascript]
----
<f:websocket ... onopen="websocketOpenListener" />
function websocketOpenListener(channel) {
// ...
}
----

The `onopen` JavaScript listener function is invoked with one argument: `channel` (the channel name, particularly useful if you have a global listener).

You can use the optional `onclose` JavaScript listener function to listen for a normal or abnormal close of a WebSocket.
This function is invoked when the very first connection attempt fails, or the server has returned close reason code `1000` (normal closure) or `1008` (policy violated), or the maximum reconnect attempts have been exceeded.
It will not be invoked if the WebSocket makes an auto-reconnect attempt on a broken connection after the first successful connection.

[source,javascript]
----
<f:websocket ... onclose="websocketCloseListener" />
function websocketCloseListener(code, channel, event) {
    if (code == -1) {
        // Websockets not supported by client.
    } else if (code == 1000) {
        // Normal close (as result of expired session or view).
    } else {
        // Abnormal close reason (as result of an error).
    }
}
----

The `onclose` JavaScript listener function is invoked with three arguments:

* `code`: The close reason code as an integer. If it is `-1`, the WebSocket is not supported by the client. If it is `1000`, then it was normally closed. Otherwise, if it is not `1000`, then there might be an error.

* `channel`: The channel name

* `event`: The `CloseEvent` instance
