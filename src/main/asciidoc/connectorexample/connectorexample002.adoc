== The trading Example

The `trading` example demonstrates how to implement and use a simple
outbound resource adapter that submits requests to a legacy EIS using a
TCP socket. The example demonstrates the scenario in
<<the-trading-example-2>> and consists of the following modules:

* `trading-eis`: A Java SE program that simulates a legacy EIS
* `trading-rar`: The outbound resource adapter implementation
* `trading-war`: A web application that uses the resource adapter
* `trading-ear`: An enterprise archive that contains the resource
adapter and the web application

The `trading-eis` module is an auxiliary project that resembles a
legacy stock trading execution platform. It contains a Java SE program
that listens for trading requests in plain text on a TCP socket. The
program replies to trading requests with a status value, a confirmation
number, and the dollar amounts for the requested shares and fees. For
example, a request-response pair would look like this:

----
>> BUY 1000 ZZZZ MARKET
<< EXECUTED #1234567 TOTAL 50400.00 FEE 252.00
----

The `trading-rar` module implements the outbound contract of the
Jakarta Connectors to submit requests and obtain responses from the
legacy stock trading execution platform. The `trading-rar` module
provides and implements a custom client interface for Jakarta EE
applications to use. This interface is simpler than the Common Client
Interface (CCI).

The `trading-war` module is a web application with a Jakarta Server
Faces interface and a managed bean. This application enables clients to
submit trades to the EIS using the resource adapter provided by the
`trading-rar` module. The `trading-war` module uses the custom client
interface provided by the resource adapter to obtain connections to the
EIS.

=== Using the Outbound Resource Adapter

In most cases, Jakarta EE application developers use outbound resource
adapters developed by a third party. Outbound resource adapters either
implement the Common Client Interface (CCI) or provide a custom
interface for applications to interact with the EIS. Outbound resource
adapters provide Jakarta EE applications with the following elements:

* Connection factories
* Connection handles
* Other interfaces and objects specific to the EIS domain

Jakarta EE applications obtain an instance of the connection factory
via resource injection and then use the factory object to obtain
connection handles to the EIS. The connection handles enable the
application to make requests and obtain information from the EIS.

The `trading-rar` module provides a custom client interface that
consists of the classes listed in
<<classes-and-interfaces-in-the-trading-rar-module>>.

|API Component |Description

|`TradeOrder` |Represents a trade order for the EIS

|`TradeResponse` |Represents a response from the EIS to a trade request

|`TradeConnection` a| Represents a connection handle to the EIS

Provides a method for applications to submit trades to the EIS

|`TradeConnectionFactory` |Enables applications to obtain connection
handles to the EIS

|`TradeProcessingException` |Indicates that a problem occurred
processing a trade request
|===

The `ResourceAccessBean` managed bean in the `trading-war` module
configures a connection factory for the `trading-rar` resource adapter
by using the `@ConnectionFactoryDefinition` annotation as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Named
@SessionScoped
@ConnectionFactoryDefinition(
    name = "java:comp/env/eis/TradeConnectionFactory",
    interfaceName = "ee.jakarta.tutorial.trading.rar.api.TradeConnectionFactory",
    resourceAdapter = "#trading-rar",
    minPoolSize = 5,
    transactionSupport =
            TransactionSupport.TransactionSupportLevel.NoTransaction
)
public class ResourceAccessBean implements Serializable { ... }
----

The `name` parameter specifies the JNDI name for the connection
factory. This example registers the connection factory in the
`java:comp` scope. You can use the `ConnectionFactoryDefinition`
annotation to specify a different scope, such as `java:global`,
`java:app`, or `java:module`. The `AdministeredObjectDefinition`
annotation also enables you to register administered connector objects
in the JNDI namespace.

The `interfaceName` parameter specifies the interface implemented by
the connection factory included in the resource adapter. In this
example, this is a custom interface.

The `resourceAdapter` parameter specifies the name of the resource
adapter that contains the connection factory implementation. The `#`
prefix in `#trading-rar` indicates that `trading-rar` is an embedded
resource adapter that is bundled in the same EAR as this web
application.

[NOTE]
You can also configure a connection factory for a previously deployed
outbound resource adapter using the administration commands from your
application server. However, this is a vendor-specific procedure.

The managed bean obtains a connection factory object using resource
injection as follows:

[source,java]
----
...
public class ResourceAccessBean implements Serializable {
    @Resource(lookup = "java:comp/env/eis/TradeConnectionFactory")
    private TradeConnectionFactory connectionFactory;
    ...
}
----

The managed bean uses the connection factory to obtain connection
handles as follows:

[source,java]
----
TradeConnection connection = connectionFactory.getConnection();
----

The resource adapter returns a connection handle associated with a
physical connection to the EIS. Once a connection handle is available,
the managed bean submits a trade and obtains the response as follows:

[source,java]
----
TradeOrder order = new TradeOrder();
order.setNShares(1000);
order.setTicker(TradeOrder.Ticker.YYYY);
order.setOrderType(TradeOrder.OrderType.BUY);
order.setOrderClass(TradeOrder.OrderClass.MARKET);
...
try {
    TradeResponse response = connection.submitOrder(order);
    ...
} catch (TradeProcessingException ex) { ... }
----

=== Implementing the Outbound Resource Adapter

The `trading-rar` module implements the outbound contract and a custom
client interface for the simple legacy stock trading platform EIS used
in this example. The architecture of the outbound resource adapter is
shown in <<architecture-of-the-trading-example>>.

[[architecture-of-the-trading-example]]
image::jakartaeett_dt_055.png["This figure shows the classes in each of the modules of the trading example.",title="Architecture of the trading Example"]

The `trading-rar` module implements the interfaces listed in
<<interfaces-implemented-in-the-trading-rar-module>>.

[[interfaces-implemented-in-the-trading-rar-module]]
[width="99%",cols="20%,20%,60%",title="Interfaces Implemented in the trading-rar Module"]
|===
|Package |Interface |Description

|`jakarta.resource.spi` |`ResourceAdapter` |Defines the lifecycle
methods of the resource adapter

|`jakarta.resource.spi` |`ManagedConnectionFactory` |Defines a
connection factory that the connection manager from the application
server uses to obtain physical connections to the EIS

|`jakarta.resource.spi` |`ManagedConnection` |Defines a physical
connection to the EIS that can be managed by the connection manager

|`trading.rar.api` |`TradeConnectionFactory` |Defines a connection
factory that applications use to obtain connection handles

|`trading.rar.api` |`TradeConnection` |Defines a connection handle that
applications use to interact with the EIS
|===

When the `trading-ear` archive is deployed and a connection pool
resource is configured as described in
<<using-the-outbound-resource-adapter>>, the application server creates
`TradeConnectionFactory` objects that applications can obtain using
resource injection. The `TradeConnectionFactory` implementation
delegates creating connections to the connection manager provided by
the application server.

The connection manager uses the `ManagedConnectionFactory`
implementation to obtain physical connections to the EIS and maintains
a pool of active physical connections. When an application requests a
connection handle, the connection manager associates a connection from
the pool with a new connection handle that the application can use.
Connection pooling improves application performance and simplifies
resource adapter development.

For more details, see the code and the comments in the `trading-rar`
module.
