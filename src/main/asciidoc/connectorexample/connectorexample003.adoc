== The traffic Example

The `traffic` example demonstrates how to implement and use a simple
inbound resource adapter that receives data from a legacy EIS using a
TCP socket.

The example is in the `_tut-install_/examples/connectors/traffic`
directory. See xref:using-the-tutorial-examples[xrefstyle=full] for
basic information on building and running sample applications.

The example demonstrates the scenario in <<the-traffic-example-2>> and
consists of the following modules:

* `traffic-eis`: A Java SE program that simulates an EIS
* `traffic-rar`: The inbound resource adapter implementation
* `traffic-ejb`: A message-driven bean that is the endpoint for incoming
messages
* `traffic-war`: A web application that displays information from the
message-driven bean
* `traffic-ear`: An enterprise archive that contains the resource
adapter, the message-driven bean, and the web application

The `traffic-eis` module is an auxiliary project that resembles a
legacy traffic information system. It contains a Java SE program that
sends traffic status updates for several cities to any subscribed
client. The program sends the updates in JSON format over a TCP socket.
For example, a traffic update looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{"report":[
    {"city":"City1", "access":"AccessA", "status":"GOOD"},
    {"city":"City1", "access":"AccessB", "status":"CONGESTED"},
    ...
    {"city":"City5", "access":"AccessE", "status":"SLOW"}
 ]}
----

The `traffic-rar` module implements the inbound contract of the Jakarta
Connectors specification. This module subscribes to the traffic
information system using the TCP port indicated by the configuration
provided by the MDB and invokes the methods of the MDB to process
traffic information updates.

The `traffic-ejb` module contains a message-driven bean that activates
the resource adapter with a configuration parameter (the TCP port to
subscribe to the traffic information system). The MDB contains a method
to process the traffic information updates. This method filters the
updates for a particular city and publishes the results to a Jakarta
Messaging topic.

The `traffic-war` module contains a message-driven bean that receives
filtered traffic information updates from the Jakarta Messaging topic
asynchronously and sends them to the clients using a WebSocket
endpoint.

=== Using the Inbound Resource Adapter

In most cases, Jakarta EE application developers use inbound resource
adapters developed by a third party. To use an inbound resource
adapter, a Jakarta EE application includes a message-driven bean with
the following characteristics.

* The MDB implements the business interface defined by the resource
adapter.
* The MDB specifies configuration parameters to activate the resource
adapter.

The business interface defined by the resource adapter is not specified
in the Jakarta Connectors specification; it is specific to the EIS.

The MDB in this example is defined as follows:

[source,java]
----
@MessageDriven(
    activationConfig = {
      @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "port",
                                propertyValue = "4008")
    }
)
public class TrafficMdb implements TrafficListener { ... }
----

The `TrafficListener` interface is defined in the API package of the
resource adapter. The resource adapter requires the MDB to provide the
`port` property.

When the MDB is deployed, it activates the `traffic-rar` resource
adapter, which invokes the methods of the MDB to process traffic
information updates. Then the MDB filters the updates for a particular
city and publishes the results to a Jakarta Messaging topic.

In this particular example, the `TrafficListener` interface is empty.
In addition to this interface, the resource adapter provides the
`TrafficCommand` annotation and uses reflection to discover which
methods in the MDB are decorated with this annotation:

[source,java]
----
@MessageDriven(...)
public class TrafficMdb implements TrafficListener {

    @TrafficCommand(name="report", info="Process report")
    public void processReport(String jsonReport) { ... }
    ...
}
----

This approach enables you to adapt the MDB to support new features in
the EIS without having to modify the `TrafficListener` interface or the
resource adapter module.

=== Implementing the Inbound Resource Adapter

The `traffic-rar` module implements the Jakarta Connectors inbound
resource adapter contract for the simple traffic information system
(EIS) used in this example. The architecture of the inbound resource
adapter is shown in <<architecture-of-the-traffic-example>>.

[[architecture-of-the-traffic-example]]
image::jakartaeett_dt_057.png["This figure shows the classes in each of the components of the traffic example.",title="Architecture of the traffic Example"]

The `traffic-rar` module implements the interfaces listed in
<<interfaces-implemented-in-the-traffic-rar-module>>.

[[interfaces-implemented-in-the-traffic-rar-module]]
[width="99%",cols="20%,20%,60%",title="Interfaces Implemented in the traffic-rar Module"]
|===
|Package |Interface |Description

|`jakarta.resource.spi` |`ResourceAdapter` |Defines the lifecycle
methods of the resource adapter.

|`jakarta.resource.spi` |`ActivationSpec` |Defines the configuration
parameters that the MDB provides to activate the inbound resource
adapter.

|`jakarta.resource.spi` |`Work` |The traffic service subscriber
implements this interface from the work management contract to wait for
traffic updates on a separate thread.
|===

When an MDB activates the inbound resource adapter, the container
invokes the `endpointActivation` method in the `TrafficResourceAdapter`
class:

[source,java]
----
@Connector(...)
public class TrafficResourceAdapter implements ResourceAdapter, Serializable {
    ...
    @Override
    public void endpointActivation(MessageEndpointFactory endpointFactory,
                                   ActivationSpec spec)
                                   throws ResourceException {
        Class endpointClass = endpointFactory.getEndpointClass();
        /* this method is called from a new thread in the example:
        MessageEndpoint endpoint = endpointFactory.createEndpoint(null); */
    }
}
----

The `getEndpointClass` method returns the `Class` type of the MDB
performing the activation, which enables the resource adapter to use
reflection to find methods annotated with `@TrafficCommand` in the MDB.

The `createEndpoint` method returns an instance of the MDB. The
resource adapter uses this instance to invoke the methods of the MDB
when it receives requests from the EIS.

After obtaining the message endpoint instance (MDB), the resource
adapter uses the work management contract to create the traffic service
subscriber thread that receives traffic updates from the EIS. The
resource adapter obtains the `WorkManager` instance from the bootstrap
context as follows:

[source,java]
----
WorkManager workManager;
...
@Override
public void start(BootstrapContext ctx) ... {
    workManager = ctx.getWorkManager();
}
----

The resource adapter schedules the traffic service subscriber thread
using the work manager:

[source,java]
----
tSubscriber = new TrafficServiceSubscriber(tSpec, endpoint);
workManager.scheduleWork(tSubscriber);
----

The `TrafficServiceSubscriber` class implements the
`jakarta.resource.spi.Work` interface from the work management
contract.

The traffic service subscriber thread uses reflection to invoke the
methods in the MDB:

[source,java]
----
private String callMdb(MessageEndpoint mdb, Method command,
                       String... params) ... {
    String resp;
    /* this code contains proper exception handling in the sources */
    mdb.beforeDelivery(command);
    Object ret = command.invoke(mdb, (Object[]) params);
    resp = (String) ret;
    mdb.afterDelivery();
    return resp;
}
----

For more details, see the code and the comments in the traffic-rar
module.
