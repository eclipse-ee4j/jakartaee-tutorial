== Web Services Interoperability and Jakarta XML Web Services

Jakarta XML Web Services supports the Web Services Interoperability
(WS-I) Basic Profile Version 1.1. The WS-I Basic Profile is a document
that clarifies the SOAP 1.1 and WSDL 1.1 specifications to promote SOAP
interoperability. For links related to WS-I, see
<<further-information-about-jakarta-xml-web-services>>.

To support WS-I Basic Profile Version 1.1, the JAX-WS runtime supports
doc/literal and rpc/literal encodings for services, static ports,
dynamic proxies, and the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII).
