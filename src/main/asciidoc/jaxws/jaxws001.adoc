== Overview of Jakarta XML Web Services

In Jakarta XML Web Services, a web service operation invocation is represented by an XML-based protocol, such as SOAP.
The SOAP specification defines the envelope structure, encoding rules, and conventions for representing web service invocations and responses.
These calls and responses are transmitted as SOAP messages (XML files) over HTTP.

Although SOAP messages are complex, the XML Web Services API hides this complexity from the application developer.
On the server side, the developer specifies the web service operations by defining methods in an interface written in the Java programming language.
The developer also codes one or more classes that implement those methods.
Client programs are also easy to code.
A client creates a proxy (a local object representing the service) and then simply invokes methods on the proxy.
With XML Web Services, the developer does not generate or parse SOAP messages.
It is the XML Web Services runtime system that converts the API calls and responses to and from SOAP messages.

With XML Web Services, clients and web services have a big advantage: the platform independence of the Java programming language.
In addition, XML Web Services is not restrictive: A XML Web Services client can access a web service that is not running on the Java platform and vice versa.
This flexibility is possible because XML Web Services uses technologies defined by the W3C: HTTP, SOAP, and WSDL.
WSDL specifies an XML format for describing a service as a set of endpoints operating on messages.

[NOTE]
Several files in the XML Web Services examples depend on the port that you specified when you installed GlassFish Server.
These tutorial examples assume that the server runs on the default port, 8080.
They do not run with a nondefault port setting.
