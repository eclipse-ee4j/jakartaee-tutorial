== Steps for Creating a Custom Component

You can apply the following steps while developing your own custom component.

. Create a custom component class that does the following:

.. Overrides the `getFamily` method to return the component family, which is used to look up renderers that can render the component

.. Includes the rendering code or delegates it to a renderer (explained in <<create-custom-component-step-2>>)

.. Enables component attributes to accept expressions

.. Queues an event on the component if the component generates events

.. Saves and restores the component state

. [[create-custom-component-step-2, Step 2]] Delegate rendering to a renderer if your component does not handle the rendering.
To do this:

.. Create a custom renderer class by extending `jakarta.faces.render.Renderer`.

.. Register the renderer to a render kit.

. Register the component.

. Create an event handler if your component generates events.

. Create a tag library descriptor (TLD) that defines the custom tag.

See <<registering-a-custom-component>> and <<registering-a-custom-renderer-with-a-render-kit>> for information on registering the custom component and the renderer.
The section <<using-a-custom-component>> discusses how to use the custom component in a Jakarta Faces page.
