== Steps for Creating a Custom Component

You can apply the following steps while developing your own custom
component.

.  Create a custom component class that does the following:
.  Overrides the `getFamily` method to return the component family, which is used to look up renderers that can render the component
.  Includes the rendering code or delegates it to a renderer (explained in Step link:#CDECBJAE[2])
.  Enables component attributes to accept expressions
.  Queues an event on the component if the component generates events
.  Saves and restores the component state
.  [[CDECBJAE]] Delegate rendering to a renderer if your component does not handle the rendering. To do this:
+
--
..  Create a custom renderer class by extending `jakarta.faces.render.Renderer`.
..  Register the renderer to a render kit.
..  Register the component.
..  Create an event handler if your component generates events.
..  Create a tag library descriptor (TLD) that defines the custom tag.

See link:#BNAXI[Registering a Custom Component] and
link:#BNAXH[Registering a Custom Renderer with a
Render Kit] for information on registering the custom component and the
renderer. The section link:#BNATT[Using a Custom
Component] discusses how to use the custom component in a Jakarta Server
Faces page.
