== The mood Example Application

The `mood` example application, located in the `_tut-install_/examples/web/servlet/mood/` directory, is a simple example that displays Duke's moods at different times during the day.
The example shows how to develop a simple application by using the `@WebServlet`, `@WebFilter`, and `@WebListener` annotations to create a servlet, a listener, and a filter.

=== Components of the mood Example Application

The `mood` example application is comprised of three components: `mood.web.MoodServlet`, `mood.web.TimeOfDayFilter`, and `mood.web.SimpleServletListener`.

`MoodServlet`, the presentation layer of the application, displays Duke's mood in a graphic, based on the time of day.
The `@WebServlet` annotation specifies the URL pattern:

[source,java]
----
@WebServlet("/report")
public class MoodServlet extends HttpServlet {
    ...
}
----

`TimeOfDayFilter` sets an initialization parameter indicating that Duke is awake:

[source,java]
----
@WebFilter(filterName = "TimeOfDayFilter",
urlPatterns = {"/*"},
initParams = {
    @WebInitParam(name = "mood", value = "awake")})
public class TimeOfDayFilter implements Filter {
    ...
}
----

The filter calls the `doFilter` method, which contains a `switch` statement that sets Duke's mood based on the current time.

`SimpleServletListener` logs changes in the servlet's lifecycle.
The log entries appear in the server log.

=== Running the mood Example

You can use either NetBeans IDE or Maven to build, package, deploy, and run the `mood` example.

==== To Run the mood Example Using NetBeans IDE

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. From the *File* menu, choose *Open Project*.

. In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/web/servlet
----

. Select the `mood` folder.

. Click *Open Project*.

. In the *Projects* tab, right-click the `mood` project and select *Build*.

. In a web browser, enter the following URL:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/mood/report
----
+
The URL specifies the context root, followed by the URL pattern.
+
A web page appears with the title "Servlet MoodServlet at /mood", a text string describing Duke's mood, and an illustrative graphic.

==== To Run the mood Example Using Maven

. Make sure that GlassFish Server has been started (see <<starting-and-stopping-glassfish-server>>).

. In a terminal window, go to:
+
----
tut-install/examples/web/servlet/mood/
----

. Enter the following command to deploy the application:
+
[source,shell]
----
mvn install
----

. In a web browser, enter the following URL:
+
----
http://localhost:8080/mood/report
----
+
The URL specifies the context root, followed by the URL pattern.
