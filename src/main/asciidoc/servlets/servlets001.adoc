== What Is a Servlet?

A servlet is a Java programming language class used to extend the
capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a
request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to
any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications
hosted by web servers. For such applications, Jakarta Servlet
technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes.

The `jakarta.servlet` and `jakarta.servlet.http` packages provide
interfaces and classes for writing servlets. All servlets must
implement the `Servlet` interface, which defines lifecycle methods.
When implementing a generic service, you can use or extend the
`GenericServlet` class provided with the Jakarta Servlet API. The
`HttpServlet` class provides methods, such as `doGet` and `doPost`, for
handling HTTP-specific services.
