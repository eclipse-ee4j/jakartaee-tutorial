== What Is a Servlet?

A servlet is a Java programming language class used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model.
Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers.
For such applications, Jakarta Servlet technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes.

The `jakarta.servlet` and `jakarta.servlet.http` packages provide interfaces and classes for writing servlets.
All servlets must implement the `Servlet` interface, which defines lifecycle methods.
When implementing a generic service, you can use or extend the `GenericServlet` class provided with the Jakarta Servlet API.
The `HttpServlet` class provides methods, such as `doGet` and `doPost`, for handling HTTP-specific services.
