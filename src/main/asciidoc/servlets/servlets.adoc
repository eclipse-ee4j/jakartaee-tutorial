= Jakarta Servlet

Jakarta Servlet is a corner stone web framework that can act as a presentation-oriented as well as a service-oriented web application.
Jakarta Servlet intends to reduce the boilerplate code needed to convert the HTTP request into a Java object and to offer a Java object as a HTTP response, and to manage all the lifecycle around them.
