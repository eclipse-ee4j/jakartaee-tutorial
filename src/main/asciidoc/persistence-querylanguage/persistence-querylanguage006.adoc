== Full Query Language Syntax

This section discusses the query language syntax, as defined in the Jakarta Persistence 3.0 specification available at https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.0/[^].
Much of the following material paraphrases or directly quotes the specification.

=== FROM Clause

The `FROM` clause defines the domain of the query by declaring identification variables.

==== Identifiers

An identifier is a sequence of one or more characters.
The first character must be a valid first character (letter, `$`, `\_`) in an identifier of the Java programming language, hereafter in this chapter called simply "`Java`".
Each subsequent character in the sequence must be a valid nonfirst character (letter, digit, `$`, `_`) in a Java identifier.
(For details, see the Java SE API documentation of the `isJavaIdentifierStart` and `isJavaIdentifierPart` methods of the `Character` class.)
The question mark (`?`) is a reserved character in the query language and cannot be used in an identifier.

A query language identifier is case-sensitive, with two exceptions:

* Keywords

* Identification variables

An identifier cannot be the same as a query language keyword.
Here is a list of query language keywords:

[width="75%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="noheader"]
|===
| `ABS` | `ALL` | `AND` | `ANY`

| `AS` | `ASC` | `AVG` | `BETWEEN`

| `BIT_LENGTH` | `BOTH` | `BY` | `CASE`

| `CHAR_LENGTH` | `CHARACTER_LENGTH` | `CLASS` | `COALESCE`

| `CONCAT` | `COUNT` | `CURRENT_DATE` | `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`

| `DELETE` | `DESC` | `DISTINCT` | `ELSE`

| `EMPTY` | `END` | `ENTRY` | `ESCAPE`

| `EXISTS` | `FALSE` | `FETCH` | `FROM`

| `GROUP` | `HAVING` | `IN` | `INDEX`

| `INNER` | `IS` | `JOIN` | `KEY`

| `LEADING` | `LEFT` | `LENGTH` | `LIKE`

| `LOCATE` | `LOWER` | `MAX` | `MEMBER`

| `MIN` | `MOD` | `NEW` | `NOT`

| `NULL` | `NULLIF` | `OBJECT` | `OF`

| `OR` | `ORDER` | `OUTER` | `POSITION`

|`SELECT` | `SET` | `SIZE` | `SOME`

| `SQRT` | `SUBSTRING` | `SUM` |`THEN`

| `TRAILING` | `TRIM` | `TRUE` | `TYPE`

| `UNKNOWN` |`UPDATE` |`UPPER` | `VALUE`

| `WHEN` 3+| `WHERE`
|===

It is not recommended that you use an SQL keyword as an identifier, because the list of keywords may expand to include other reserved SQL words in the future.

==== Identification Variables

An identification variable is an identifier declared in the `FROM` clause.
Although they can reference identification variables, the `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses cannot declare them.
All identification variables must be declared in the `FROM` clause.

Because it is an identifier, an identification variable has the same naming conventions and restrictions as an identifier, with the exception that an identification variable is case-insensitive.
For example, an identification variable cannot be the same as a query language keyword.
(See <<identifiers>> for more naming rules.)
Also, within a given persistence unit, an identification variable name must not match the name of any entity or abstract schema.

The `FROM` clause can contain multiple declarations, separated by commas.
A declaration can reference another identification variable that has been previously declared (to the left).
In the following `FROM` clause, the variable `t` references the previously declared variable `p`:

[source,sql]
----
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) AS t
----

Even if it is not used in the `WHERE` clause, an identification variable's declaration can affect the results of the query.
For example, compare the next two queries.
The following query returns all players, whether or not they belong to a team:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p
FROM Player p
----

In contrast, because it declares the `t` identification variable, the next query fetches all players who belong to a team:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) AS t
----

The following query returns the same results as the preceding query, but the `WHERE` clause makes it easier to read:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p
FROM Player p
WHERE p.teams IS NOT EMPTY
----

An identification variable always designates a reference to a single value whose type is that of the expression used in the declaration.
There are two kinds of declarations: range variable and collection member.

==== Range Variable Declarations

To declare an identification variable as an abstract schema type, you specify a range variable declaration.
In other words, an identification variable can range over the abstract schema type of an entity.
In the following example, an identification variable named `p` represents the abstract schema named `Player`:

[source,sql]
----
FROM Player p
----

A range variable declaration can include the optional `AS` operator:

[source,sql]
----
FROM Player AS p
----

To obtain objects, a query usually uses path expressions to navigate through the relationships.
But for those objects that cannot be obtained by navigation, you can use a range variable declaration to designate a starting point, or query root.

If the query compares multiple values of the same abstract schema type, the `FROM` clause must declare multiple identification variables for the abstract schema:

[source,sql]
----
FROM Player p1, Player p2
----

For an example of such a query, see <<comparison-operators>>.

==== Collection Member Declarations

In a one-to-many relationship, the multiple side consists of a collection of entities.
An identification variable can represent a member of this collection.
To access a collection member, the path expression in the variable's declaration navigates through the relationships in the abstract schema.
(For more information on path expressions, see <<path-expressions>>.) Because a path expression can be based on another path expression, the navigation can traverse several relationships.
See <<traversing-multiple-relationships>>.

A collection member declaration must include the `IN` operator but can omit the optional `AS` operator.

In the following example, the entity represented by the abstract schema named `Player` has a relationship field called `teams`.
The identification variable called `t` represents a single member of the `teams` collection:

[source,sql]
----
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) t
----

==== Joins

The `JOIN` operator is used to traverse over relationships between entities and is functionally similar to the `IN` operator.

In the following example, the query joins over the relationship between customers and orders:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o
WHERE c.status = 1 AND o.totalPrice > 10000
----

The `INNER` keyword is optional:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c INNER JOIN c.orders o
WHERE c.status = 1 AND o.totalPrice > 10000
----

These examples are equivalent to the following query, which uses the `IN` operator:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c, IN (c.orders) o
WHERE c.status = 1 AND o.totalPrice > 10000
----

You can also join a single-valued relationship:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT t
FROM Team t JOIN t.league l
WHERE l.sport = :sport
----

A `LEFT JOIN` or `LEFT OUTER JOIN` retrieves a set of entities where matching values in the join condition may be absent.
The `OUTER` keyword is optional:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.name, o.totalPrice
FROM CustomerOrder o LEFT JOIN o.customer c
----

A `FETCH JOIN` is a join operation that returns associated entities as a side effect of running the query.
In the following example, the query returns a set of departments and, as a side effect, the associated employees of the departments, even though the employees were not explicitly retrieved by the `SELECT` clause:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT d
FROM Department d LEFT JOIN FETCH d.employees
WHERE d.deptno = 1
----

=== Path Expressions

Path expressions are important constructs in the syntax of the query language for several reasons.
First, path expressions define navigation paths through the relationships in the abstract schema.
These path definitions affect both the scope and the results of a query.
Second, path expressions can appear in any of the main clauses of a query (`SELECT`, `DELETE`, `HAVING`, `UPDATE`, `WHERE`, `FROM`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`).
Finally, although much of the query language is a subset of SQL, path expressions are extensions not found in SQL.

==== Examples of Path Expressions

Here, the `WHERE` clause contains a `single_valued_path_expression`; the `p` is an identification variable, and `salary` is a persistent field of `Player`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT p
FROM Player p
WHERE p.salary BETWEEN :lowerSalary AND :higherSalary
----

Here, the `WHERE` clause also contains a `single_valued_path_expression`; `t` is an identification variable, `league` is a single-valued relationship field, and `sport` is a persistent field of `league`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT p
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) t
WHERE t.league.sport = :sport
----

Here, the `WHERE` clause contains a `collection_valued_path_expression`; `p` is an identification variable, and `teams` designates a collection-valued relationship field:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT p
FROM Player p
WHERE p.teams IS EMPTY
----

==== Expression Types

The type of a path expression is the type of the object represented by the ending element, which can be one of the following:

* Persistent field

* Single-valued relationship field

* Collection-valued relationship field

For example, the type of the expression `p.salary` is `double` because the terminating persistent field (`salary`) is a `double`.

In the expression `p.teams`, the terminating element is a collection-valued relationship field (`teams`).
This expression's type is a collection of the abstract schema type named `Team`.
Because `Team` is the abstract schema name for the `Team` entity, this type maps to the entity.
For more information on the type mapping of abstract schemas, see <<return-types>>.

==== Navigation

A path expression enables the query to navigate to related entities.
The terminating elements of an expression determine whether navigation is allowed.
If an expression contains a single-valued relationship field, the navigation can continue to an object that is related to the field.
However, an expression cannot navigate beyond a persistent field or a collection-valued relationship field.
For example, the expression `p.teams.league.sport` is illegal because `teams` is a collection-valued relationship field.
To reach the `sport` field, the `FROM` clause could define an identification variable named `t` for the `teams` field:

[source,sql]
----
FROM Player AS p, IN (p.teams) t
WHERE t.league.sport = 'soccer'
----

=== WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause specifies a conditional expression that limits the values returned by the query.
The query returns all corresponding values in the data store for which the conditional expression is `TRUE`.
Although usually specified, the `WHERE` clause is optional.
If the `WHERE` clause is omitted, the query returns all values.
The high-level syntax for the `WHERE` clause is as follows:

[source,sql]
----
where_clause ::= WHERE conditional_expression
----

==== Literals

There are four kinds of literals: string, numeric, Boolean, and enum.

* String literals: A string literal is enclosed in single quotes:
+
[source,java]
----
'Duke'
----
+
If a string literal contains a single quote, you indicate the quote by using two single quotes:
+
[source,java]
----
'Duke''s'
----
+
Like a Java `String`, a string literal in the query language uses the Unicode character encoding.

* Numeric literals: There are two types of numeric literals: exact and approximate.

** An exact numeric literal is a numeric value without a decimal point, such as 65, –233, and +12.
Using the Java integer syntax, exact numeric literals support numbers in the range of a Java `long`.

** An approximate numeric literal is a numeric value in scientific notation, such as 57., –85.7, and +2.1.
Using the syntax of the Java floating-point literal, approximate numeric literals support numbers in the range of a Java `double`.

* Boolean literals: A Boolean literal is either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
These keywords are not case-sensitive.

* Enum literals: The Jakarta Persistence query language supports the use of enum literals using the Java enum literal syntax.
The enum class name must be specified as a fully qualified class name:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT e
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.status = com.example.EmployeeStatus.FULL_TIME
----

==== Input Parameters

An input parameter can be either a named parameter or a positional parameter.

* A named input parameter is designated by a colon (`:`) followed by a string; for example, `:name`.

* A positional input parameter is designated by a question mark (`?`) followed by an integer.
For example, the first input parameter is `?1`, the second is `?2`, and so forth.

The following rules apply to input parameters.

* They can be used only in a `WHERE` or `HAVING` clause.

* Positional parameters must be numbered, starting with the integer 1.

* Named parameters and positional parameters may not be mixed in a single query.

* Named parameters are case-sensitive.

==== Conditional Expressions

A `WHERE` clause consists of a conditional expression, which is evaluated from left to right within a precedence level.
You can change the order of evaluation by using parentheses.

==== Operators and Their Precedence

<<query-language-order-precedence>> lists the query language operators in order of decreasing precedence.

[[query-language-order-precedence]]
.Query Language Order Precedence
[width="75%",cols="25%,45%"]
|===
|Type |Precedence Order

|Navigation |`.` (a period)

|Arithmetic a| `+ –` (unary)

`* /` (multiplication and division)

`+ –` (addition and subtraction)

|Comparison a| `=`

`>`

`>=`

`<`

`<=`

`<>` (not equal)

`[NOT] BETWEEN`

`[NOT] LIKE`

`[NOT] IN`

`IS [NOT] NULL`

`IS [NOT] EMPTY`

`[NOT] MEMBER OF`

|Logical a| `NOT`

`AND`

`OR`
|===

==== BETWEEN Expressions

A `BETWEEN` expression determines whether an arithmetic expression falls within a range of values.

These two expressions are equivalent:

[source,sql]
----
p.age BETWEEN 15 AND 19
p.age >= 15 AND p.age <= 19
----

The following two expressions also are equivalent:

[source,sql]
----
p.age NOT BETWEEN 15 AND 19
p.age < 15 OR p.age > 19
----

If an arithmetic expression has a `NULL` value, the value of the `BETWEEN` expression is unknown.

==== IN Expressions

An `IN` expression determines whether a string belongs to a set of string literals or whether a number belongs to a set of number values.

The path expression must have a string or numeric value.
If the path expression has a `NULL` value, the value of the `IN` expression is unknown.

In the following example, the expression is `TRUE` if the country is `UK` , but `FALSE` if the country is `Peru`:

[source,sql]
----
o.country IN ('UK', 'US', 'France')
----

You may also use input parameters:

[source,sql]
----
o.country IN ('UK', 'US', 'France', :country)
----

==== LIKE Expressions

A `LIKE` expression determines whether a wildcard pattern matches a string.

The path expression must have a string or numeric value.
If this value is `NULL`, the value of the `LIKE` expression is unknown.
The pattern value is a string literal that can contain wildcard characters.
The underscore (`_`) wildcard character represents any single character.
The percent (`%`) wildcard character represents zero or more characters.
The `ESCAPE` clause specifies an escape character for the wildcard characters in the pattern value.
<<like-expression-examples>> shows some sample `LIKE` expressions.

[[like-expression-examples]]
.LIKE Expression Examples
[width=75%",cols="35%,20%,20%"]
|===
|Expression |TRUE |FALSE

|`address.phone LIKE '12%3'` | `'123'` +
`'12993'` |`'1234'`

|`asentence.word LIKE 'l_se'` |`'lose'` |`'loose'`

|`aword.underscored LIKE '\_%' ESCAPE '\'` |`'_foo'` |`'bar'`

|`address.phone NOT LIKE '12%3'` |`'1234'` |`'123'` +
`'12993'`
|===

==== NULL Comparison Expressions

A `NULL` comparison expression tests whether a single-valued path expression or an input parameter has a `NULL` value.
Usually, the `NULL` comparison expression is used to test whether a single-valued relationship has been set:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT t
FROM Team t
WHERE t.league IS NULL
----

This query selects all teams where the league relationship is not set.
Note that the following query is not equivalent:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT t
FROM Team t
WHERE t.league = NULL
----

The comparison with `NULL` using the equals operator (`=`) always returns an unknown value, even if the relationship is not set.
The second query will always return an empty result.

==== Empty Collection Comparison Expressions

The `IS [NOT] EMPTY` comparison expression tests whether a collection-valued path expression has no elements.
In other words, it tests whether a collection-valued relationship has been set.

If the collection-valued path expression is `NULL`, the empty collection comparison expression has a `NULL` value.

Here is an example that finds all orders that do not have any line items:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM CustomerOrder o
WHERE o.lineItems IS EMPTY
----

==== Collection Member Expressions

The `[NOT]` `MEMBER [OF]` collection member expression determines whether a value is a member of a collection.
The value and the collection members must have the same type.

If either the collection-valued or single-valued path expression is unknown, the collection member expression is unknown.
If the collection-valued path expression designates an empty collection, the collection member expression is `FALSE`.

The `OF` keyword is optional.

The following example tests whether a line item is part of an order:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM CustomerOrder o
WHERE :lineItem MEMBER OF o.lineItems
----

==== Subqueries

Subqueries may be used in the `WHERE` or `HAVING` clause of a query.
Subqueries must be surrounded by parentheses.

The following example finds all customers who have placed more than ten orders:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c
FROM Customer c
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(o) FROM c.orders o) > 10
----

Subqueries may contain `EXISTS`, `ALL`, and `ANY` expressions.

* EXISTS expressions: The `[NOT] EXISTS` expression is used with a subquery and is true only if the result of the subquery consists of one or more values; otherwise, it is false.
+
The following example finds all employees whose spouses are also employees:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT emp
FROM Employee emp
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT spouseEmp
    FROM Employee spouseEmp
    WHERE spouseEmp = emp.spouse)
----

* ALL and ANY expressions: The `ALL` expression is used with a subquery and is true if all the values returned by the subquery are true or if the subquery is empty.
+
The `ANY` expression is used with a subquery and is true if some of the values returned by the subquery are true.
An `ANY` expression is false if the subquery result is empty or if all the values returned are false.
The `SOME` keyword is synonymous with `ANY`.
+
The `ALL` and `ANY` expressions are used with the `=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `<>` comparison operators.
+
The following example finds all employees whose salaries are higher than the salaries of the managers in the employee's department:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT emp
FROM Employee emp
WHERE emp.salary > ALL (
    SELECT m.salary
    FROM Manager m
    WHERE m.department = emp.department)

==== Functional Expressions

The query language includes several string, arithmetic, and date/time functions that may be used in the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `HAVING` clause of a query.
The functions are listed in <<string-expressions>>, <<arithmetic-expressions>> and <<date-time-expressions>>.

In <<string-expressions>>, the `start` and `length` arguments are of type `int` and designate positions in the `String` argument.
The first position in a string is designated by 1.

[[string-expressions]]
.String Expressions
[width="75%",cols="45%,25%"]
|===
|Function Syntax |Return Type

|`CONCAT(String, String)` |`String`

|`LENGTH(String)` |`int`

|`LOCATE(String, String [, start])` |`int`

|`SUBSTRING(String, start, length)` |`String`

|`TRIM([[LEADING\|TRAILING\|BOTH] char FROM] String)` |`String`

|`LOWER(String)` |`String`

|`UPPER(String)` |`String`
|===

The `CONCAT` function concatenates two strings into one string.

The `LENGTH` function returns the length of a string in characters as an integer.

The `LOCATE` function returns the position of a given string within a string.
This function returns the first position at which the string was found as an integer.
The first argument is the string to be located.
The second argument is the string to be searched.
The optional third argument is an integer that represents the starting string position.
By default, `LOCATE` starts at the beginning of the string.
The starting position of a string is `1`.
If the string cannot be located, `LOCATE` returns `0`.

The `SUBSTRING` function returns a string that is a substring of the first argument based on the starting position and length.

The `TRIM` function trims the specified character from the beginning and/or end of a string.
If no character is specified, `TRIM` removes spaces or blanks from the string.
If the optional `LEADING` specification is used, `TRIM` removes only the leading characters from the string.
If the optional `TRAILING` specification is used, `TRIM` removes only the trailing characters from the string.
The default is `BOTH`, which removes the leading and trailing characters from the string.

The `LOWER` and `UPPER` functions convert a string to lowercase or uppercase, respectively.

In <<arithmetic-expressions>>, the `number` argument can be an `int`, a `float`, or a `double`.

[[arithmetic-expressions]]
.Arithmetic Expressions

|Function Syntax |Return Type

|`ABS(number)` |`int`, `float`, or `double`

|`MOD(int, int)` |`int`

|`SQRT(double)` |`double`

|`SIZE(Collection)` |`int`
|===

The `ABS` function takes a numeric expression and returns a number of the same type as the argument.

The `MOD` function returns the remainder of the first argument divided by the second.

The `SQRT` function returns the square root of a number.

The `SIZE` function returns an integer of the number of elements in the given collection.

In <<date-time-expressions>>, the date/time functions return the date, time, or timestamp on the database server.

|===
|Function Syntax |Return Type

|`CURRENT_DATE` |`java.sql.Date`

|`CURRENT_TIME` |`java.sql.Time`

|`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` |`java.sql.Timestamp`
|===

==== Case Expressions

Case expressions change based on a condition, similar to the `case` keyword of the Java programming language.
The `CASE` keyword indicates the start of a case expression, and the expression is terminated by the `END` keyword.
The `WHEN` and `THEN` keywords define individual conditions, and the `ELSE` keyword defines the default condition should none of the other conditions be satisfied.

The following query selects the name of a person and a conditional string, depending on the subtype of the `Person` entity.
If the subtype is `Student`, the string `kid` is returned.
If the subtype is `Guardian` or `Staff`, the string `adult` is returned.
If the entity is some other subtype of `Person`, the string `unknown` is returned:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p.name
CASE TYPE(p)
    WHEN Student THEN 'kid'
    WHEN Guardian THEN 'adult'
    WHEN Staff THEN 'adult'
    ELSE 'unknown'
END
FROM Person p
----

The following query sets a discount for various types of customers.
Gold-level customers get a 20% discount, silver-level customers get a 15% discount, bronze-level customers get a 10% discount, and everyone else gets a 5% discount:

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE Customer c
SET c.discount =
    CASE c.level
        WHEN 'Gold' THEN 20
        WHEN 'SILVER' THEN 15
        WHEN 'Bronze' THEN 10
        ELSE 5
    END
----

==== NULL Values

If the target of a reference is not in the persistent store, the target is `NULL`.
For conditional expressions containing `NULL`, the query language uses the semantics defined by SQL92.
Briefly, these semantics are as follows.

* If a comparison or arithmetic operation has an unknown value, it yields a `NULL` value.

* Two `NULL` values are not equal.
Comparing two `NULL` values yields an unknown value.

* The `IS NULL` test converts a `NULL` persistent field or a single-valued relationship field to `TRUE`.
The `IS NOT NULL` test converts them to `FALSE`.

* Boolean operators and conditional tests use the three-valued logic defined by <<and-operator-logic>> and <<or-operator-logic>>.
(In these tables, T stands for `TRUE`, F for `FALSE`, and U for unknown.)

|T |T |T |T

|===

==== Equality Semantics

In the query language, only values of the same type can be compared.
However, this rule has one exception: Exact and approximate numeric values can be compared.
In such a comparison, the required type conversion adheres to the rules of Java numeric promotion.

The query language treats compared values as if they were Java types and not as if they represented types in the underlying data store.
For example, a persistent field that could be either an integer or a `NULL` must be designated as an `Integer` object and not as an `int` primitive.
This designation is required because a Java object can be `NULL`, but a primitive cannot.

Two strings are equal only if they contain the same sequence of characters.
Trailing blanks are significant; for example, the strings `'abc'` and `'abc '` are not equal.

Two entities of the same abstract schema type are equal only if their primary keys have the same value.
<<not-operator-logic>> shows the operator logic of a negation, and <<conditional-test>> shows the truth values of conditional tests.

=== SELECT Clause

The `SELECT` clause defines the types of the objects or values returned by the query.

==== Return Types

The return type of the `SELECT` clause is defined by the result types of the select expressions contained within it.
If multiple expressions are used, the result of the query is an `Object[]`, and the elements in the array correspond to the order of the expressions in the `SELECT` clause and in type to the result types of each expression.

A `SELECT` clause cannot specify a collection-valued expression.
For example, the `SELECT` clause `p.teams` is invalid because `teams` is a collection.
However, the clause in the following query is valid because `t` is a single element of the `teams` collection:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT t
FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) t
----

The following query is an example of a query with multiple expressions in the `SELECT` clause:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.name, c.country.name
FROM customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Coss' AND c.firstname = 'Roxane'
----

This query returns a list of `Object[]` elements; the first array element is a string denoting the customer name, and the second array element is a string denoting the name of the customer's country.

The result of a query may be the result of an aggregate function, listed in <<aggregate-functions-in-select-statements>>.

[[aggregate-functions-in-select-statements]]
.Aggregate Functions in Select Statements
[width="80%",cols="15%,50%,64%"]
|===
|Name |Return Type |Description

|`AVG` |`Double` |Returns the mean average of the fields

|`COUNT` |`Long` |Returns the total number of results

|`MAX` |The type of the field |Returns the highest value in the result set

|`MIN` |The type of the field |Returns the lowest value in the result set

|`SUM` a| `Long` (for integral fields) +
`Double` (for floating-point fields) +
`BigInteger` (for `BigInteger` fields) +
`BigDecimal` (for `BigDecimal` fields) |Returns the sum of all the values in the result set
|===

For select method queries with an aggregate function (`AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, or `SUM`) in the `SELECT` clause, the following rules apply.

* The `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `SUM` functions return `null` if there are no values to which the function can be applied.

* The `COUNT` function returns 0 if there are no values to which the function can be applied.

The following example returns the average order quantity:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT AVG(o.quantity)
FROM CustomerOrder o
----

The following example returns the total cost of the items ordered by Roxane Coss:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT SUM(l.price)
FROM CustomerOrder o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Coss' AND c.firstname = 'Roxane'
----

The following example returns the total number of orders:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(o)
FROM CustomerOrder o
----

The following example returns the total number of items that have prices in Hal Incandenza's order:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT COUNT(l.price)
FROM CustomerOrder o JOIN o.lineItems l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Incandenza' AND c.firstname = 'Hal'
----

==== The DISTINCT Keyword

The `DISTINCT` keyword eliminates duplicate return values.
If a query returns a `java.util.Collection`, which allows duplicates, you must specify the `DISTINCT` keyword to eliminate duplicates.

==== Constructor Expressions

Constructor expressions allow you to return Java instances that store a query result element instead of an `Object[]`.

The following query creates a `CustomerDetail` instance per `Customer` matching the `WHERE` clause.
A `CustomerDetail` stores the customer name and customer's country name.So the query returns a `List` of `CustomerDetail` instances:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT NEW com.example.CustomerDetail(c.name, c.country.name)
FROM customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Coss' AND c.firstname = 'Roxane'
----

=== ORDER BY Clause

As its name suggests, the `ORDER BY` clause orders the values or objects returned by the query.

If the `ORDER BY` clause contains multiple elements, the left-to-right sequence of the elements determines the high-to-low precedence.

The `ASC` keyword specifies ascending order, the default, and the `DESC` keyword indicates descending order.

When using the `ORDER BY` clause, the `SELECT` clause must return an orderable set of objects or values.
You cannot order the values or objects for values or objects not returned by the `SELECT` clause.
For example, the following query is valid because the `ORDER BY` clause uses the objects returned by the `SELECT` clause:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT o
FROM Customer c JOIN c.orders o JOIN c.address a
WHERE a.state = 'CA'
ORDER BY o.quantity, o.totalcost
----

The following example is not valid, because the `ORDER BY` clause uses a value not returned by the `SELECT` clause:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT p.product_name
FROM CustomerOrder o, IN(o.lineItems) l JOIN o.customer c
WHERE c.lastname = 'Faehmel' AND c.firstname = 'Robert'
ORDER BY o.quantity
----

=== GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses

The `GROUP BY` clause allows you to group values according to a set of properties.

The following query groups the customers by their country and returns the number of customers per country:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.country, COUNT(c)
FROM Customer c GROUP BY c.country
----

The `HAVING` clause is used with the `GROUP BY` clause to further restrict the returned result of a query.

The following query groups orders by the status of their customer and returns the customer status plus the average `totalPrice` for all orders where the corresponding customers have the same status.
In addition, it considers only customers with status `1`, `2`, or `3`, so orders of other customers are not taken into account:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT c.status, AVG(o.totalPrice)
FROM CustomerOrder o JOIN o.customer c
GROUP BY c.status HAVING c.status IN (1, 2, 3)
----
