== Overview of the Jakarta Persistence Query Language

The query language uses the abstract persistence schemas of entities, including their relationships, for its data model and defines operators and expressions based on this data model.
The scope of a query spans the abstract schemas of related entities that are packaged in the same persistence unit.
The query language uses an SQL-like syntax to select objects or values based on entity abstract schema types and relationships among them.
