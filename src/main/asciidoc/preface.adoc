== Preface

This tutorial is a guide to developing enterprise applications for the Jakarta EE 9 Platform, using Eclipse GlassFish Server.

Eclipse GlassFish Server is the leading open-source and open-community platform for building and deploying next-generation applications and services.
Eclipse GlassFish Server, developed by the Eclipse GlassFish project open-source community at https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.glassfish[^], is a compatible implementation of the Jakarta EE 9 platform specification.
This lightweight, flexible, and open-source application server enables organizations not only to leverage the new capabilities introduced within the Jakarta EE 9 specification, but also to add to their existing capabilities through a faster and more streamlined development and deployment cycle.
Eclipse GlassFish Server is hereafter referred to as GlassFish Server.

=== Audience

This tutorial is intended for programmers interested in developing and deploying Jakarta EE 9 applications.
It covers the technologies comprising the Jakarta EE platform and describes how to develop Jakarta EE components and deploy them on the Eclipse GlassFish.

=== Before You Read This Book

Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a good knowledge of the Java programming language.
A good way to get to that point is to work through the Java(TM) Tutorials https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html[^].

=== Related Documentation

The GlassFish Server documentation set describes deployment planning and system installation.
To obtain the GlassFish Server documentation, go to https://glassfish.org/docs[^].

The Jakarta EE 9 API specification can be viewed at https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/[^].

Additionally, the Jakarta EE Specifications at https://jakarta.ee/specifications[^] might be useful.
