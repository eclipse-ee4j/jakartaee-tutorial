== The Contents of an Enterprise Bean

To develop an enterprise bean, you must provide the following files.

* Enterprise bean class: Implements the business methods of the
enterprise bean and any lifecycle callback methods.
* Business interfaces: Define the business methods implemented by the
enterprise bean class. A business interface is not required if the
enterprise bean exposes a local, no-interface view.
* Helper classes: Other classes needed by the enterprise bean class,
such as exception and utility classes.

Package the programming artifacts in the preceding list either into an
Enterprise Bean JAR file (a stand-alone module that stores the enterprise bean) or
within a web application archive (WAR) module. See
link:#CHDFCDBG[Packaging Enterprise Beans in Enterprise Bean JAR
Modules] and link:#CHDJABEJ[Packaging Enterprise Beans
in WAR Modules] for more information.
