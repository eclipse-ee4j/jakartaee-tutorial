= Enterprise Beans

Enterprise beans are Jakarta EE components that implement Jakarta Enterprise Beans technology.
Enterprise beans run in the Enterprise Bean container, a runtime environment within GlassFish Server (see <<container-types>>).
Although transparent to the application developer, the Enterprise Bean container provides system-level services, such as transactions and security, to its enterprise beans.
These services enable you to quickly build and deploy enterprise beans, which form the core of transactional Jakarta EE applications.
