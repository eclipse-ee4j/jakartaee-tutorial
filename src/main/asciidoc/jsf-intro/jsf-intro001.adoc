== Introduction to Jakarta Faces Technology

Jakarta Faces technology consists of the following:

* An API for representing components and managing their state; handling events, server-side validation, and data conversion; defining page navigation; supporting internationalization and accessibility; and providing extensibility for all these features

* Tag libraries for adding components to web pages and for connecting components to server-side objects

Jakarta Faces technology provides a well-defined programming model and various tag libraries.
The tag libraries contain tag handlers that implement the component tags.
These features significantly ease the burden of building and maintaining web applications with server-side user interfaces (UIs).
With minimal effort, you can complete the following tasks.

* Create a web page.

* Drop components onto a web page by adding component tags.

* Bind components on a page to server-side data.

* Wire component-generated events to server-side application code.

* Save and restore application state beyond the life of server requests.

* Reuse and extend components through customization.

This chapter provides an overview of Jakarta Faces technology.
After explaining what a Jakarta Faces application is and reviewing some of the primary benefits of using Jakarta Faces technology, this chapter describes the process of creating a simple Jakarta Faces application.
This chapter also introduces the Jakarta Faces lifecycle by describing the example Jakarta Faces application and its progression through the lifecycle stages.
