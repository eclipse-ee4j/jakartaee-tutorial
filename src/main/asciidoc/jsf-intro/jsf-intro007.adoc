== The Lifecycle of a Jakarta Server Faces Application

The lifecycle of an application refers to the various stages of
processing of that application, from its initiation to its conclusion.
All applications have lifecycles. During a web application lifecycle,
common tasks are performed, including the following.

* Handling incoming requests
* Decoding parameters
* Modifying and saving state
* Rendering web pages to the browser

The Jakarta Server Faces web application framework manages lifecycle phases
automatically for simple applications or allows you to manage them
manually for more complex applications as required.

Jakarta Server Faces applications that use advanced features may
require interaction with the lifecycle at certain phases. For example,
Ajax applications use partial processing features of the lifecycle (see
<<partial-processing-and-partial-rendering>>). A clearer understanding
of the lifecycle phases is key to creating well-designed components.

A simplified view of the Jakarta Server faces lifecycle, consisting of
the two main phases of a Jakarta Server Faces web application, is
introduced in <<a-simple-jakarta-server-faces-application>>. This
section examines the Jakarta Server Faces lifecycle in more detail.

=== Overview of the Jakarta Server Faces Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a Jakarta Server Faces application begins when the client
makes an HTTP request for a page and ends when the server responds with
the page, translated to HTML.

The lifecycle can be divided into two main phases: Execute and Render.
The Execute phase is further divided into subphases to support the
sophisticated component tree. This structure requires that component
data be converted and validated, component events be handled, and
component data be propagated to beans in an orderly fashion.

A Jakarta Server Faces page is represented by a tree of components, called a
view. During the lifecycle, the Jakarta Server Faces implementation must
build the view while considering the state saved from a previous
submission of the page. When the client requests a page, the Jakarta Server
Faces implementation performs several tasks, such as validating the data
input of components in the view and converting input data to types
specified on the server side.

The Jakarta Server Faces implementation performs all these tasks as a
series of steps in the Jakarta Server Faces request-response lifecycle.
<<jakarta-server-faces-standard-request-response-lifecycle>>
illustrates these steps.

The request-response lifecycle handles two kinds of requests: initial
requests and postbacks. An initial request occurs when a user makes a
request for a page for the first time. A postback request occurs when a
user submits the form contained on a page that was previously loaded
into the browser as a result of executing an initial request.

When the lifecycle handles an initial request, it executes only the
Restore View and Render Response phases, because there is no user input
or action to process. Conversely, when the lifecycle handles a postback,
it executes all of the phases.

Usually, the first request for a Jakarta Server Faces page comes in
from a client, as a result of clicking a link or button component on a
Jakarta Server Faces page. To render a response that is another Jakarta
Server Faces page, the application creates a new view and stores it in
the `jakarta.faces.context.FacesContext` instance, which represents all
of the information associated with processing an incoming request and
creating a response. The application then acquires object references
needed by the view and calls the `FacesContext.renderResponse` method,
which forces immediate rendering of the view by skipping to the
<<render-response-phase>> of the lifecycle, as is shown by the arrows
labelled Render Response in
<<jakarta-server-faces-standard-request-response-lifecycle>>.

Sometimes, an application might need to redirect to a different web
application resource, such as a web service, or generate a response that
does not contain Jakarta Server Faces components. In these situations, the
developer must skip the Render Response phase by calling the
`FacesContext.responseComplete` method. This situation is also shown in
, with the arrows labelled Response Complete.

The most common situation is that a Jakarta Server Faces component submits a
request for another Jakarta Server Faces page. In this case, the Jakarta Server
Faces implementation handles the request and automatically goes through
the phases in the lifecycle to perform any necessary conversions,
validations, and model updates and to generate the response.

There is one exception to the lifecycle described in this section. When
a component's `immediate` attribute is set to `true`, the validation,
conversion, and events associated with these components are processed
during the <<apply-request-values-phase>> rather than in a later phase.

The details of the lifecycle explained in the following sections are
primarily intended for developers who need to know information such as
when validations, conversions, and events are usually handled and ways
to change how and when they are handled. For more information on each of
the lifecycle phases, download the latest Jakarta Server Faces Specification
documentation from https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/[^].

The Jakarta Server Faces application lifecycle Execute phase contains the
following subphases:

* <<restore-view-phase>>
* <<apply-request-values-phase>>
* <<process-validations-phase>>
* <<update-model-values-phase>>
* <<invoke-application-phase>>
* <<render-response-phase>>

=== Restore View Phase

When a request for a Jakarta Server Faces page is made, usually by an
action, such as when a link or a button component is clicked, the
Jakarta Server Faces implementation begins the Restore View phase.

During this phase, the Jakarta Server Faces implementation builds the view
of the page, wires event handlers and validators to components in the
view, and saves the view in the `FacesContext` instance, which contains
all the information needed to process a single request. All the
application's components, event handlers, converters, and validators
have access to the `FacesContext` instance.

If the request for the page is an initial request, the Jakarta Server Faces
implementation creates an empty view during this phase and the lifecycle
advances to the Render Response phase, during which the empty view is
populated with the components referenced by the tags in the page.

If the request for the page is a postback, a view corresponding to this
page already exists in the `FacesContext` instance. During this phase,
the Jakarta Server Faces implementation restores the view by using the state
information saved on the client or the server.

=== Apply Request Values Phase

After the component tree is restored during a postback request, each
component in the tree extracts its new value from the request parameters
by using its `decode` (`processDecodes()`) method. The value is then
stored locally on each component.

If any `decode` methods or event listeners have called the
`renderResponse` method on the current `FacesContext` instance, the
Jakarta Server Faces implementation skips to the Render Response phase.

If any events have been queued during this phase, the Jakarta Server Faces
implementation broadcasts the events to interested listeners.

If some components on the page have their `immediate` attributes (see
<<the-immediate-attribute>>) set to `true`, then the validations,
conversions, and events associated with these components will be
processed during this phase. If any conversion fails, an error message
associated with the component is generated and queued on
`FacesContext`. This message will be displayed during the Render
Response phase, along with any validation errors resulting from the
Process Validations phase.

At this point, if the application needs to redirect to a different web
application resource or generate a response that does not contain any
Jakarta Server Faces components, it can call the
`FacesContext.responseComplete` method.

At the end of this phase, the components are set to their new values,
and messages and events have been queued.

If the current request is identified as a partial request, the partial
context is retrieved from the `FacesContext`, and the partial processing
method is applied.

=== Process Validations Phase

During this phase, the Jakarta Server Faces implementation processes
all validators registered on the components in the tree by using its
`validate` (`processValidators`) method. It examines the component
attributes that specify the rules for the validation and compares these
rules to the local value stored for the component. The Jakarta Server
Faces implementation also completes conversions for input components
that do not have the `immediate` attribute set to true.

If the local value is invalid, or if any conversion fails, the Jakarta
Server Faces implementation adds an error message to the `FacesContext`
instance, and the lifecycle advances directly to the Render Response
phase so that the page is rendered again with the error messages
displayed. If there were conversion errors from the Apply Request
Values phase, the messages for these errors are also displayed.

If any `validate` methods or event listeners have called the
`renderResponse` method on the current `FacesContext`, the Jakarta
Server Faces implementation skips to the Render Response phase.

At this point, if the application needs to redirect to a different web
application resource or generate a response that does not contain any
Jakarta Server Faces components, it can call the
`FacesContext.responseComplete` method.

If events have been queued during this phase, the Jakarta Server Faces
implementation broadcasts them to interested listeners.

If the current request is identified as a partial request, the partial
context is retrieved from the `FacesContext`, and the partial processing
method is applied.

=== Update Model Values Phase

After the Jakarta Server Faces implementation determines that the data
is valid, it traverses the component tree and sets the corresponding
server-side object properties to the components' local values. The
Jakarta Server Faces implementation updates only the bean properties
pointed at by an input component's `value` attribute. If the local data
cannot be converted to the types specified by the bean properties, the
lifecycle advances directly to the Render Response phase so that the
page is re-rendered with errors displayed. This is similar to what
happens with validation errors.

If any `updateModels` methods or any listeners have called the
`renderResponse` method on the current `FacesContext` instance, the
Jakarta Server Faces implementation skips to the Render Response phase.

At this point, if the application needs to redirect to a different web
application resource or generate a response that does not contain any
Jakarta Server Faces components, it can call the
`FacesContext.responseComplete` method.

If any events have been queued during this phase, the Jakarta Server Faces
implementation broadcasts them to interested listeners.

If the current request is identified as a partial request, the partial
context is retrieved from the `FacesContext`, and the partial processing
method is applied.

=== Invoke Application Phase

During this phase, the Jakarta Server Faces implementation handles any
application-level events, such as submitting a form or linking to
another page.

At this point, if the application needs to redirect to a different web
application resource or generate a response that does not contain any
Jakarta Server Faces components, it can call the
`FacesContext.responseComplete` method.

If the view being processed was reconstructed from state information
from a previous request and if a component has fired an event, these
events are broadcast to interested listeners.

Finally, the Jakarta Server Faces implementation transfers control to the
Render Response phase.

=== Render Response Phase

During this phase, Jakarta Server Faces builds the view and delegates
authority to the appropriate resource for rendering the pages.

If this is an initial request, the components that are represented on
the page will be added to the component tree. If this is not an initial
request, the components are already added to the tree and need not be
added again.

If the request is a postback and errors were encountered during the
Apply Request Values phase, Process Validations phase, or Update Model
Values phase, the original page is rendered again during this phase. If
the pages contain `h:message` or `h:messages` tags, any queued error
messages are displayed on the page.

After the content of the view is rendered, the state of the response is
saved so that subsequent requests can access it. The saved state is
available to the Restore View phase.
