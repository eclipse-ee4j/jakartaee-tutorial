== Jakarta Server Faces Technology Benefits

One of the greatest advantages of Jakarta Server Faces technology is
that it offers a clean separation between behavior and presentation for
web applications. A Jakarta Server Faces application can map HTTP
requests to component-specific event handling and manage components as
stateful objects on the server. Jakarta Server Faces technology allows
you to build web applications that implement the finer-grained
separation of behavior and presentation that is traditionally offered
by client-side UI architectures.

The separation of logic from presentation also allows each member of a
web application development team to focus on a single piece of the
development process and provides a simple programming model to link the
pieces. For example, page authors with no programming expertise can use
Jakarta Server Faces technology tags in a web page to link to
server-side objects without writing any scripts.

Another important goal of Jakarta Server Faces technology is to
leverage familiar component and web-tier concepts without limiting you
to a particular scripting technology or markup language. Jakarta Server
Faces technology APIs are layered directly on top of the Servlet API,
as shown in <<web-application-technologies>>.

This layering of APIs enables several important application use cases,
such as using different presentation technologies, creating your own
custom components directly from the component classes, and generating
output for various client devices.

Facelets technology, available as part of Jakarta Server Faces
technology, is the preferred presentation technology for building
Jakarta Server Faces technology–based web applications. For more
information on Facelets technology features, see
xref:introduction-to-facelets[xrefstyle=full].

Facelets technology offers several advantages.

* Code can be reused and extended for components through the templating
and composite component features.
* You can use annotations to automatically register the managed bean as
a resource available for Jakarta Server Faces applications. In
addition, implicit navigation rules allow developers to quickly
configure page navigation (see <<navigation-model>> for details). These
features reduce the manual configuration process for applications.
* Most important, Jakarta Server Faces technology provides a rich
architecture for managing component state, processing component data,
validating user input, and handling events.
