== Partial Processing and Partial Rendering

The Jakarta Faces lifecycle spans all of the execute and render processes of an application.
It is also possible to process and render only parts of an application, such as a single component.
For example, the Jakarta Faces Ajax framework can generate requests containing information on which particular component may be processed and which particular component may be rendered back to the client.

Once such a partial request enters the Jakarta Faces lifecycle, the information is identified and processed by a `jakarta.faces.context.PartialViewContext` object.
The Jakarta Faces lifecycle is still aware of such Ajax requests and modifies the component tree accordingly.

The `execute` and `render` attributes of the `f:ajax` tag are used to identify which components may be executed and rendered.
For more information on these attributes, see xref:using-ajax-with-jakarta-faces-technology[xrefstyle=full].
