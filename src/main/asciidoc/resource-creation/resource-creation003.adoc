== Creating Resources Administratively

Before you deploy or run many applications, you may need to create resources for them.
An application can include a `glassfish-resources.xml` file that can be used to define resources for that application and others.
You can then use the `asadmin` command, specifying as the argument a file named `glassfish-resources.xml`, to create the resources administratively, as shown.

[source,shell]
----
asadmin add-resources glassfish-resources.xml
----

The `glassfish-resources.xml` file can be created in any project using NetBeans IDE or by hand.
Some of the Jakarta Messaging examples use this approach to resource creation.
A file for creating the resources needed for the Messaging simple producer example can be found in the `jms/simple/producer/src/main/setup` directory.

You could also use the `asadmin create-jms-resource` command to create the resources for this example.
When you are done using the resources, you would use the `asadmin list-jms-resources` command to display their names, and the `asadmin delete-jms-resource` command to remove them, regardless of the way you created the resources.
