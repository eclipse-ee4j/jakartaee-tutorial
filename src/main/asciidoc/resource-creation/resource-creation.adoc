3 Resource Creation
-------------------


A resource is a program object that provides connections to such systems
as database servers and messaging systems. Jakarta EE components can access
a wide variety of resources, including databases, mail sessions, Jakarta
Messaging objects, and URLs. The Jakarta EE platform provides
mechanisms that allow you to access all these resources in a similar
manner. This chapter examines several types of resources and explains
how to create them.
