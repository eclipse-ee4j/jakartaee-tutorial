A resource is a program object that provides connections to such systems as database servers and messaging systems.
Jakarta EE components can access a wide variety of resources, including databases, mail sessions, Jakarta Messaging objects, and URLs.
The Jakarta EE platform provides mechanisms that allow you to access all these resources in a similar manner.
