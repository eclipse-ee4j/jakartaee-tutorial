== Using Programmatic Security with Web Applications

Programmatic security is used by security-aware applications when declarative security alone is not sufficient to express the security model of the application.

=== Authenticating Users Programmatically

You can use the `SecurityContext` and `HttpServletRequest` interfaces to authenticate users for a web application programmatically.

==== SecurityContext

The `SecurityContext` interface, as specified in the Jakarta Security specification, defines the following method to programmatically trigger the authentication process:

* `authenticate()` allows an application to signal to the container that it should start the authentication process with the caller.

Programmatically triggering means that the container responds as if the caller had attempted to access a constrained resource.
It causes the container to invoke the authentication mechanism configured for the application.
If the configured authentication mechanism is an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`, then the `AuthenticationParameters` argument is meaningful and extended capabilities of `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` are available.
If not, the behavior and result is as if `HttpServletRequest.authenticate()` were called.

==== HttpServletRequest

The `HttpServletRequest` interface defines the following methods that enable you to authenticate users for a web application programmatically.

* `authenticate` allows an application to instigate authentication of the request caller by the container from within an unconstrained request context.
A login dialog box displays and collects the user name and password for authentication purposes.

* `login` allows an application to collect user name and password information as an alternative to specifying form-based authentication in an application deployment descriptor.

* `logout` allows an application to reset the caller identity of a request.

The following example code shows how to use the `login` and `logout` methods:

    protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setContentType("text/html;charset=UTF-8");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        try {

            out.println("<html>");
            out.println("<head>");
            out.println("<title>Servlet TutorialServlet</title>");
            out.println("</head>");
            out.println("<body>");
            request.login("TutorialUser", "TutorialUser");
            BigDecimal result =
                converterBean.dollarToYen(new BigDecimal("1.0"));
            out.println("<h1>Servlet TutorialServlet result of dollarToYen= "
                + result + "</h1>");
            out.println("</body>");
            out.println("</html>");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new ServletException(e);
        } finally {
            request.logout();
            out.close();
        }
    }

import jakarta.servlet.*;
import jakarta.servlet.http.*;

public class TestServlet extends HttpServlet {

    protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request,
            HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setContentType("text/html;charset=UTF-8");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        try {
            request.authenticate(response);
            out.println("Authenticate Successful");
        } finally {
            out.close();
        }
    }
}

=== Checking Caller Identity Programmatically

In general, the container enforces security management in a manner that is transparent to the web component.
Use the security APIs described in this section only in the less frequent situations in which the web component methods need to access the security context information.

The Jakarta Security specification defines the following methods of the `SecurityContext` interface that allow the application to test aspects of the caller data:

* `getCallerPrincipal()` retrieves the `Principal` representing the caller.
This is the container-specific representation of the caller principal, and the type may differ from the type of the caller principal originally established by an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`.
This method returns null for an unauthenticated caller.

* `getPrincipalsByType()` retrieves all principals of the given type.
This method can be used to retrieve an application-specific caller principal established during authentication.
This method is primarily useful in the case that the container’s caller principal is a different type than the application caller principal, and the application needs specific information behavior available only from the application principal.
This method returns an empty `Set` if the caller is unauthenticated, or if the requested type is not found.
+
Where both a container caller principal and an application caller principal are present, the value returned by `getName()` is the same for both principals.

* `isCallerInRole()` takes a String argument that represents the role to be tested.
The specification does not define how the role determination is made, but the result must be the same as if the corresponding container-specific call had been made (for example `HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole()`, `EJBContext.isCallerInRole()`), and must be consistent with the result implied by specifications that prescribe role-mapping behavior.

Servlet 5.0 specifies the following methods that enable you to access security information about the component's caller.

* `getRemoteUser` determines the user name with which the client authenticated.
The `getRemoteUser` method returns the name of the remote user (the caller) associated by the container with the request.
If no user has been authenticated, this method returns `null`.

* `isUserInRole` determines whether a remote user is in a specific security role.
If no user has been authenticated, this method returns `false`.
This method expects a `String` user `role-name` parameter.
+
The `security-role-ref` element should be declared in the deployment descriptor with a `role-name` subelement containing the role name to be passed to the method.
Using security role references is discussed in <<declaring-and-linking-role-references>>.

* `getUserPrincipal` determines the principal name of the current user and returns a `java.security.Principal` object.
If no user has been authenticated, this method returns `null`.
Calling the `getName` method on the `Principal` returned by `getUserPrincipal` returns the name of the remote user.

Your application can make business-logic decisions based on the information obtained using these APIs.

=== Testing Access to a Resource Programmatically

The `SecurityContext` interface, as specified in the Jakarta Security API specification, defines the following method for programmatically testing access to a resource:

* `hasAccessToWebResource()` method determines if the caller has access to the specified web resource for the specified HTTP methods, as determined by the security constraints configured for the application.
+
The resource parameter is an `URLPatternSpec`, as defined by Jakarta Authorization (https://jakarta.ee/specifications/authorization/2.0/[^]), that identifies an application-specific web resource.
+
This method can be used to check access to resources in the current application only — it cannot be called cross-application, or cross-container, to check access to resources in a different application.

For example, consider the following Servlet definition:

[source,java]
----
@WebServlet("/protectedServlet")
@ServletSecurity(@HttpConstraint(rolesAllowed = "foo"))
public class ProtectedServlet extends HttpServlet { ... }
----

And the following call to `hasAccessToWebResource()`:

[source,java]
----
securityContext.hasAccessToWebResource("/protectedServlet", GET)
----

The above `hasAccessToWebResource()` call returns true if, and only if, the caller is in role "foo".

=== Example Code for Programmatic Security

The following code demonstrates the use of programmatic security for the purposes of programmatic login.
This servlet does the following.

. It displays information about the current user.

. It prompts the user to log in.

. It prints out the information again to demonstrate the effect of the `login` method.

. It logs the user out.

. It prints out the information again to demonstrate the effect of the `logout` method.

=== Declaring and Linking Role References

A security role reference is a mapping between the name of a role that is called from a web component using `isUserInRole(String role)` and the name of a security role that has been defined for the application.
If no `security-role-ref` element is declared in a deployment descriptor and the `isUserInRole` method is called, the container defaults to checking the provided role name against the list of all security roles defined for the web application.
Using the default method instead of using the `security-role-ref` element limits your flexibility to change role names in an application without also recompiling the servlet making the call.

The `security-role-ref` element is used when an application uses the `HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole(String role)`.
The value passed to the `isUserInRole` method is a `String` representing the role name of the user.
The value of the `role-name` element must be the `String` used as the parameter to the `HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole(String role)`.
The `role-link` must contain the name of one of the security roles defined in the `security-role` elements.
The container uses the mapping of `security-role-ref` to `security-role` when determining the return value of the call.

For example, to map the security role reference `cust` to the security role with role name `bankCustomer`, the elements would look like this:

[source,xml]
----
<servlet>
...
    <security-role-ref>
        <role-name>cust</role-name>
        <role-link>bankCustomer</role-link>
    </security-role-ref>
...
</servlet>
----

If the servlet method is called by a user in the `bankCustomer` security role, `isUserInRole("cust")` returns `true`.

The `role-link` element in the `security-role-ref` element must match a `role-name` defined in the `security-role` element of the same `web.xml` deployment descriptor, as shown here:

[source,xml]
----
<security-role>
    <role-name>bankCustomer</role-name>
</security-role>
----

A security role reference, including the name defined by the reference, is scoped to the component whose deployment descriptor contains the `security-role-ref` deployment descriptor element.
