== Using the @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy Annotations with CDI Managed Bean Classes

CDI managed bean classes and their superclasses support the annotations for initializing and for preparing for the destruction of a bean.
These annotations are defined in Jakarta Annotations (https://jakarta.ee/specifications/annotations/2.0/[^]).

=== To Initialize a Managed Bean Using the @PostConstruct Annotation

Initializing a managed bean specifies the lifecycle callback method that the CDI framework should call after dependency injection but before the class is put into service.

. In the managed bean class or any of its superclasses, define a method that performs the initialization that you require.

. Annotate the declaration of the method with the `jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct` annotation.

When the managed bean is injected into a component, CDI calls the method after all injection has occurred and after all initializers have been called.

[NOTE]
As mandated in Jakarta Annotations, if the annotated method is declared in a superclass, the method is called unless a subclass of the declaring class overrides the method.

The `UserNumberBean` managed bean in <<the-guessnumber-cdi-cdi-example>> uses `@PostConstruct` to annotate a method that resets all bean fields:

[source,java]
----
@PostConstruct
public void reset () {
    this.minimum = 0;
    this.userNumber = 0;
    this.remainingGuesses = 0;
    this.maximum = maxNumber;
    this.number = randomInt.get();
}
----

=== To Prepare for the Destruction of a Managed Bean Using the @PreDestroy Annotation

Preparing for the destruction of a managed bean specifies the lifecycle call back method that signals that an application component is about to be destroyed by the container.

. In the managed bean class or any of its superclasses, prepare for the destruction of the managed bean.
+
In this method, perform any cleanup that is required before the bean is destroyed, such as releasing a resource that the bean has been holding.

. Annotate the declaration of the method with the `jakarta.annotation.PreDestroy` annotation.

CDI calls this method before starting to destroy the bean.
