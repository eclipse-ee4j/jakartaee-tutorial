== Configuring a CDI Application

When your beans are annotated with a scope type, the server recognizes
the application as a bean archive and no additional configuration is
required. The possible scope types for CDI beans are listed in
<<using-scopes>>.

CDI uses an optional deployment descriptor named `beans.xml`. Like
other Jakarta EE deployment descriptors, the configuration settings in
`beans.xml` are used in addition to annotation settings in CDI classes.
The settings in `beans.xml` override the annotation settings if there
is a conflict. An archive must contain the `beans.xml` deployment
descriptor only in certain limited situations, described in
xref:jakarta-contexts-and-dependency-injection-advanced-topics[xrefstyle=full].

For a web application, the `beans.xml` deployment descriptor, if
present, must be in the `WEB-INF` directory. For EJB modules or JAR
files, the `beans.xml` deployment descriptor, if present, must be in
the `META-INF` directory.
