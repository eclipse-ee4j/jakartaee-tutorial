== Beans as Injectable Objects

The concept of injection has been part of Java technology for some time.
Since the Java EE 5 platform was introduced, annotations have made it possible to inject resources and some other kinds of objects into container-managed objects.
CDI makes it possible to inject more kinds of objects and to inject them into objects that are not container-managed.

The following kinds of objects can be injected:

* Almost any Java class

* Session beans

* Jakarta EE resources: data sources, Messaging topics, queues, connection factories, and the like

* Persistence contexts (Jakarta Persistence `EntityManager` objects)

* Producer fields

* Objects returned by producer methods

* Web service references

* Remote enterprise bean references

For example, suppose that you create a simple Java class with a method that returns a string:

[source,java]
----
package greetings;

public class Greeting {
    public String greet(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + ".";
    }
}
----

This class becomes a bean that you can then inject into another class.
This bean is not exposed to the EL in this form.
<<giving-beans-el-names>> explains how you can make a bean accessible to the EL.
