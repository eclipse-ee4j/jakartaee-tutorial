== Giving Beans EL Names

To make a bean accessible through the EL, use the `@Named` built-in qualifier:

[source,java]
----
import jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.inject.Named;

@Named
@RequestScoped
public class Printer {

    @Inject @Informal Greeting greeting;
    ...
}
----

The `@Named` qualifier allows you to access the bean by using the bean
name, with the first letter in lowercase. For example, a Facelets page
would refer to the bean as `printer`.

You can specify an argument to the `@Named` qualifier to use a
nondefault name:

[source,java]
----
@Named("MyPrinter")
----

With this annotation, the Facelets page would refer to the bean as
`MyPrinter`.
