== About CDI Managed Beans

A managed bean is implemented by a Java class, which is called its bean
class. A top-level Java class is a managed bean if it is defined to be
a managed bean by any other Jakarta EE technology specification, such
as the Jakarta Server Faces technology specification, or if it meets
all the following conditions.

* It is not a nonstatic inner class.
* It is a concrete class or is annotated `@Decorator`.
* It is not annotated with an enterprise bean component-defining
annotation or declared as an enterprise bean class in `ejb-jar.xml`.
* It has an appropriate constructor. That is, one of the following is
the case.

** The class has a constructor with no parameters.

** The class declares a constructor annotated `@Inject`.

No special declaration, such as an annotation, is required to define a
managed bean.
