== Distributed Multitiered Applications

The Jakarta EE platform uses a distributed multitiered application model
for enterprise applications. Application logic is divided into
components according to function, and the application components that
make up a Jakarta EE application are installed on various machines
depending on the tier in the multitiered Jakarta EE environment to which
the application component belongs.

<<figure-1-1>> shows two multitiered Jakarta EE applications divided
into the tiers described in the following list. The Jakarta EE
application parts shown in <<figure-1-1>> are presented in
<<jakarta-ee-components>>.

* Client-tier components run on the client machine.
* Web-tier components run on the Jakarta EE server.
* Business-tier components run on the Jakarta EE server.
* Enterprise information system (EIS)-tier software runs on the EIS
server.

Although a Jakarta EE application can consist of all tiers shown in
<<figure-1-1>>, Jakarta EE multitiered applications are generally
considered to be three-tiered applications because they are distributed
over three locations: client machines, the Jakarta EE server machine,
and the database or legacy machines at the back end. Three-tiered
applications that run in this way extend the standard two-tiered
client-and-server model by placing a multithreaded application server
between the client application and back-end storage.

=== Security

Although other enterprise application models require platform-specific
security measures in each application, the Jakarta EE security
environment enables security constraints to be defined at deployment
time. The Java EE platform makes applications portable to a wide
variety of security implementations by shielding application developers
from the complexity of implementing security features.

The Jakarta EE platform provides standard declarative access control
rules that are defined by the developer and interpreted when the
application is deployed on the server. Jakarta EE also provides
standard login mechanisms so that application developers do not have to
implement these mechanisms in their applications. The same application
works in a variety of security environments without changing the source
code.

=== Jakarta EE Components

Jakarta EE applications are made up of components. A Jakarta EE
component is a self-contained functional software unit that is
assembled into a Jakarta EE application with its related classes and
files and that communicates with other components.

The Jakarta EE specification defines the following Jakarta EE
components:

* Application clients and applets are components that run on the
client.

* Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Faces, and Jakarta Server Pages technology
components are web components that run on the server.

* Enterprise bean components (enterprise beans) are business components
that run on the server.

Jakarta EE components are written in the Java programming language and
are compiled in the same way as any program in the language. The
differences between Jakarta EE components and "standard" Java classes
are that Jakarta EE components are assembled into a Jakarta EE
application, they are verified to be well formed and in compliance with
the Jakarta EE specification, and they are deployed to production,
where they are run and managed by the Jakarta EE server.

=== Jakarta EE Clients

A Jakarta EE client is usually either a web client or an application
client.

==== Web Clients

A web client consists of two parts:

* Dynamic web pages containing various types of markup language (HTML,
XML, and so on), which are generated by web components running in the
web tier
* A web browser, which renders the pages received from the server

A web client is sometimes called a thin client. Thin clients usually do
not query databases, execute complex business rules, or connect to
legacy applications. When you use a thin client, such heavyweight
operations are off-loaded to enterprise beans executing on the Jakarta EE
server, where they can leverage the security, speed, services, and
reliability of Jakarta EE server-side technologies.

==== Application Clients

An application client runs on a client machine and provides a way for
users to handle tasks that require a richer user interface than can be
provided by a markup language. An application client typically has a
graphical user interface (GUI) created from the Swing API or the
Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) API, but a command-line interface is
certainly possible.

Application clients directly access enterprise beans running in the
business tier. However, if application requirements warrant it, an
application client can open an HTTP connection to establish
communication with a servlet running in the web tier. Application
clients written in languages other than Java can interact with Jakarta
EE servers, enabling the Jakarta EE platform to interoperate with
legacy systems, clients, and non-Java languages.

==== Applets

A web page received from the web tier can include an embedded applet.
Written in the Java programming language, an applet is a small client
application that executes in the Java virtual machine installed in the
web browser. However, client systems will likely need the Java Plug-in
and possibly a security policy file for the applet to successfully
execute in the web browser.

Web components are the preferred API for creating a web client program
because no plug-ins or security policy files are needed on the client
systems. Also, web components enable cleaner and more modular
application design because they provide a way to separate applications
programming from web page design. Personnel involved in web page design
thus do not need to understand Java programming language syntax to do
their jobs.

==== The JavaBeans Component Architecture

The server and client tiers might also include components based on the
JavaBeans component architecture (JavaBeans components) to manage the
data flow between the following:

* An application client or applet and components running on the Jakarta
EE server
* Server components and a database

JavaBeans components are not considered Jakarta EE components by the
Jakarta EE specification.

JavaBeans components have properties and have `get` and `set` methods
for accessing those properties. JavaBeans components used in this way
are typically simple in design and implementation but should conform to
the naming and design conventions outlined in the JavaBeans component
architecture.

==== Jakarta EE Server Communications

<<figure-1-2>> shows the various elements that can make up the client
tier. The client communicates with the business tier running on the
Jakarta EE server either directly or, as in the case of a client
running in a browser, by going through web pages or servlets running in
the web tier.

[[figure-1-2, Figure 1-2]] 
.*Figure 1-2 Server Communication*

Application clients access the business tier directly. Browsers, web
pages, and applets access the web tier."]

=== Web Components

Jakarta EE web components are either servlets or web pages created
using Jakarta Faces technology and/or Jakarta Server Pages technology.
Servlets are Java programming language classes that dynamically process
requests and construct responses. Jakarta Server Pages are text-based
documents that execute as servlets but allow a more natural approach to
creating static content. Jakarta Faces technology builds on servlets
and Jakarta Server Pages technology and provides a user interface
component framework for web applications.

Static HTML pages and applets are bundled with web components during
application assembly but are not considered web components by the Java
EE specification. Server-side utility classes can also be bundled with
web components and, like HTML pages, are not considered web components.

As shown in <<figure-1-3>>, the web tier, like the client tier, might
include a JavaBeans component to manage the user input and send that
input to enterprise beans running in the business tier for processing.

showing detail of JavaBeans components and web pages in the web tier."]

=== Business Components

Business code, which is logic that solves or meets the needs of a
particular business domain such as banking, retail, or finance, is
handled by enterprise beans running in either the business tier or the
web tier. <<figure-1-4>> shows how an enterprise bean receives
data from client programs, processes it (if necessary), and sends it to
the enterprise information system tier for storage. An enterprise bean
also retrieves data from storage, processes it (if necessary), and
sends it back to the client program.

the business tier."]

=== Enterprise Information System Tier

The enterprise information system tier handles EIS software and
includes enterprise infrastructure systems, such as enterprise resource
planning (ERP), mainframe transaction processing, database systems, and
other legacy information systems. For example, Jakarta EE application
components might need access to enterprise information systems for
database connectivity.
