== Jakarta EE Application Assembly and Deployment

A Jakarta EE application is packaged into one or more standard units
for deployment to any Jakarta EE platform-compliant system. Each unit
contains

* A functional component or components, such as an enterprise bean, web
page, servlet, or applet

* An optional deployment descriptor that describes its content

Once a Jakarta EE unit has been produced, it is ready to be deployed.
Deployment typically involves using a platform's deployment tool to
specify location-specific information, such as a list of local users
who can access it and the name of the local database. Once deployed on
a local platform, the application is ready to run.
