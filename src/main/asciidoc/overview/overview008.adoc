The following sections give a brief summary of the technologies
required by the Jakarta EE platform and the APIs used in Jakarta EE
applications.

=== Jakarta Enterprise Beans Technology

An enterprise bean component, or enterprise bean, is a body of code
that has fields and methods to implement modules of business logic. You
can think of an enterprise bean as a building block that can be used
alone or with other enterprise beans to execute business logic on the
Jakarta EE server.

Enterprise beans are either session beans or message-driven beans.

* A session bean represents a transient conversation with a client.
When the client finishes executing, the session bean and its data are
gone.

* A message-driven bean combines features of a session bean and a
message listener, allowing a business component to receive messages
asynchronously. Commonly, these are Jakarta Messaging messages.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 and
Jakarta Interceptors 2.0.

=== Jakarta Servlet Technology

Jakarta Servlet technology lets you define HTTP-specific servlet
classes. A servlet class extends the capabilities of servers that host
applications accessed by way of a request-response programming model.
Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly
used to extend the applications hosted by web servers.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new Jakarta Servlet technology features
include the following:

* Server Push
* HTTP Trailer

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Servlet 5.0.

=== Jakarta Faces Technology

Jakarta Faces technology is a user interface framework for building web
applications. The main components of Jakarta Faces technology are as
follows:

* A GUI component framework.

* A flexible model for rendering components in different kinds of HTML
or different markup languages and technologies. A `Renderer` object
generates the markup to render the component and converts the data
stored in a model object to types that can be represented in a view.

* A standard `RenderKit` for generating HTML 4.01 markup.

The following features support the GUI components:

* Input validation
* Event handling
* Data conversion between model objects and components
* Managed model object creation
* Page navigation configuration
* Jakarta Expression Language

All this functionality is available using standard Java APIs and
XML-based configuration files.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new features of Jakarta Faces technology
include the following:

* Direct support for WebSockets via the new `<f:websocket>` tag
* Class-level bean validation via the new `<f:validateWholeBean>` tag
* A Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection compatible
`@ManagedProperty` annotation
* Enhanced component search expression
framework

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Faces 3.0 and Jakarta
Expression Language 4.0.

=== Jakarta Server Pages Technology

Jakarta Server Pages technology lets you put snippets of servlet code
directly into a text-based document. A Jakarta Server Pages page is a
text-based document that contains two types of text:

* Static data, which can be expressed in any text-based format, such as
HTML or XML

* JSP elements, which determine how the page constructs dynamic content

The Jakarta Server Pages technology is derived from and compatible with
the JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology. 

For information about JSP technology, see _The Java EE 5 Tutorial_ at
http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/[^].

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Server Pages 3.0 for compatibility
with earlier releases but recommends the use of Facelets as the display
technology in new applications.

=== Jakarta Standard Tag Library

The Jakarta Standard Tag Library encapsulates core functionality common
to many Jakarta Server Pages applications. Instead of mixing tags from
numerous vendors in your Jakarta Server Pages applications, you use a
single, standard set of tags. This standardization allows you to deploy
your applications on any Jakarta Server Pages container that supports
Jakarta Standard Tag Library and makes it more likely that the
implementation of the tags is optimized.

Jakarta Standard Tag Library has iterator and conditional tags for
handling flow control, tags for manipulating XML documents,
internationalization tags, tags for accessing databases using SQL, and
tags for commonly used functions.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Standard Tag Library 2.0.

=== Jakarta Persistence

Jakarta Persistence is a Java standards–based solution for persistence.
Persistence uses an object/relational mapping approach to bridge the
gap between an object-oriented model and a relational database. The
Jakarta Persistence can also be used in Java SE applications outside of
the Jakarta EE environment. Jakarta Persistence consists of the
following areas:

* The Jakarta Persistence
* The query language
* Object/relational mapping metadata

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Persistence 3.0.

=== Jakarta Transactions

Jakarta Transactions provides a standard interface for demarcating
transactions. The Jakarta EE architecture provides a default auto
commit to handle transaction commits and rollbacks. An auto commit
means that any other applications that are viewing data will see the
updated data after each database read or write operation. However, if
your application performs two separate database access operations that
depend on each other, you will want to use the Jakarta Transactions to
demarcate where the entire transaction, including both operations,
begins, rolls back, and commits.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Transactions 2.0.

=== Jakarta RESTful Web Services

Jakarta RESTful Web Services defines APIs for the development of web
services built according to the Representational State Transfer (REST)
architectural style. A Jakarta RESTful application is a web application
that consists of classes packaged as a servlet in a WAR file along with
required libraries.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new RESTful web services features include
the following:

* Reactive Client API +
When the results of an invocation on a target
resource are received, enhancements to the completion stage APIs in
Java SE allow the sequence of those results to be specified,
prioritized, combined, or concatenated, and how exceptions can be
handled.

* Enhancements in support for server-sent events +
Clients may subscribe to server-issued event notifications using a
long-running connection. Support for a new media type,
text/event-stream, has been added.

* Support for Jakarta JSON Binding objects, and improved integration
with Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection, Jakarta Servlet, and
Jakarta Bean Validation technologies

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.0.

=== Jakarta Managed Beans

Jakarta Managed Beans, lightweight container-managed objects (POJOs)
with minimal requirements, support a small set of basic services, such
as resource injection, lifecycle callbacks, and interceptors. Managed
Beans represent a generalization of the managed beans specified by
Jakarta Faces technology and can be used anywhere in a Jakarta EE
application, not just in web modules.

The Jakarta Managed Beans specification is part of the Jakarta EE 9
platform specification. The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta
Managed Beans 2.0.

=== Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection

Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) defines a set of
contextual services, provided by Jakarta EE containers, that make it
easy for developers to use enterprise beans along with Jakarta Faces
technology in web applications. Designed for use with stateful objects,
CDI also has many broader uses, allowing developers a great deal of
flexibility to integrate different kinds of components in a loosely
coupled but typesafe way.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new CDI features include the following:

* An API for bootstrapping a CDI container in Java SE 8

* Support for observer ordering, which determines the order in which
the observer methods for a particular event are invoked, and support
for firing events asynchronously

* Configurators interfaces, which are used for dynamically defining and
modifying CDI objects

* Built-in annotation literals, a convenience feature for creating
instances of annotations, and more

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 3.0.

=== Jakarta Dependency Injection

Jakarta Dependency Injection defines a standard set of annotations (and
one interface) for use on injectable classes.

In the Jakarta EE platform, CDI provides support for Dependency
Injection. Specifically, you can use injection points only in a
CDI-enabled application.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Dependency Injection 2.0.

=== Jakarta Bean Validation

The Jakarta Bean Validation specification defines a metadata model and
API for validating data in JavaBeans components. Instead of
distributing validation of data over several layers, such as the
browser and the server side, you can define the validation constraints
in one place and share them across the different layers.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new Jakarta Bean Validation features
include the following:

* Support for new features in Java SE 8, such as the Date-Time API
* Addition of new built-in Jakarta Bean Validation constraints

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Bean Validation 3.0.

=== Jakarta Messaging

Jakarta Messaging is a messaging standard that allows Jakarta EE
application components to create, send, receive, and read messages. It
enables distributed communication that is loosely coupled, reliable,
and asynchronous.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Messaging 3.0.

=== Jakarta Connectors

The Jakarta Connectors is used by tools vendors and system integrators
to create resource adapters that support access to enterprise
information systems that can be plugged in to any Jakarta EE product. A
resource adapter is a software component that allows Jakarta EE
application components to access and interact with the underlying
resource manager of the EIS. Because a resource adapter is specific to
its resource manager, a different resource adapter typically exists for
each type of database or enterprise information system.

The Jakarta Connectors also provides a performance-oriented, secure,
scalable, and message-based transactional integration of Jakarta EE
platform-based web services with existing EISs that can be either
synchronous or asynchronous. Existing applications and EISs integrated
through the Jakarta Connectors into the Jakarta EE platform can be
exposed as XML-based web services by using Jakarta XML Web Services and
Jakarta EE component models. Thus Jakarta XML Web Services and the
Jakarta Connectors are complementary technologies for enterprise
application integration (EAI) and end-to-end business integration.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Connectors 2.0.

=== Jakarta Mail

Jakarta EE applications use the Jakarta Mail to send email
notifications. The Jakarta Mail has two parts:

* An application-level interface used by the application components to
send mail
* A service provider interface

The Jakarta EE platform includes the Jakarta Mail with a service
provider that allows application components to send Internet mail.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Mail 2.0.

=== Jakarta Authorization

The Jakarta Authorization specification defines a contract between a
Jakarta EE application server and an authorization policy provider. All
Jakarta EE containers support this contract.

The Jakarta Authorization specification defines
`java.security.Permission` classes that satisfy the Jakarta EE
authorization model. The specification defines the binding of
container-access decisions to operations on instances of these
permission classes. It defines the semantics of policy providers that
use the new permission classes to address the authorization
requirements of the Jakarta EE platform, including the definition and
use of roles.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Authorization 2.0.

=== Jakarta Authentication

The Jakarta Authentication specification defines a service provider
interface (SPI) by which authentication providers that implement
message authentication mechanisms may be integrated in client or server
message-processing containers or runtimes. Authentication providers
integrated through this interface operate on network messages provided
to them by their calling containers. The authentication providers
transform outgoing messages so that the source of each message can be
authenticated by the receiving container, and the recipient of the
message can be authenticated by the message sender. Authentication
providers authenticate each incoming message and return to their
calling containers the identity established as a result of the message
authentication.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Authentication 2.0.

=== Jakarta Security

Jakarta Security specification defines portable, plug-in interfaces for
HTTP authentication and identity stores, and an injectable
`SecurityContext` interface that provides an API for programmatic
security.

Implementations of the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface can be
used to authenticate callers of web applications. An application can
supply its own `HttpAuthenticationMechanism`, or use one of the default
implementations provided by the container.

Implementations of the `IdentityStore` interface can be used to
validate user credentials and retrieve group information. An
application can provide its own `IdentityStore`, or use the built in
LDAP or Database store.

The `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` and `IdentityStore` APIs provide an
advantage over container-provided implementations in that they allow an
application to control the authentication process, and the identity
stores used for authentication, in a standard, portable way.

The `SecurityContext` API is intended for use by application code to
query and interact with the current security context. The specification
also provides for default group-to-role mapping, and defines a
principal type called `CallerPrincipal` that can represent the identity
of an application caller.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Security 2.0.

=== Jakarta WebSocket

WebSocket is an application protocol that provides full-duplex
communications between two peers over TCP. Jakarta WebSocket enables
Jakarta EE applications to create endpoints using annotations that
specify the configuration parameters of the endpoint and designate its
lifecycle callback methods.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta WebSocket 2.0.

=== Jakarta JSON Processing

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text-based data exchange format
derived from JavaScript that is used in web services and other
connected applications. Jakarta JSON Processing enables Jakarta EE
applications to parse, transform, and query JSON data using the object
model or the streaming model.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new features of Jakarta JSON Processing
include support for the following:

* JSON Pointer +
Defines a string syntax for referencing a specific value within a JSON
document. JSON Pointer includes APIs for extracting values from a
target document and transforming them to create a new JSON document.

* JSON Patch +
Defines a format for expressing a sequence of operations to be applied
to a JSON document.

* JSON Merge Patch +
Defines a format and processing rules for applying operations to a JSON
document that are based upon specific content of the target document.

* The addition of editing and transformation functions to basic JSON
document processing.

* Helper classes and methods, called JSON Collectors, which leverage
features of the Stream API that was introduced in Java SE 8.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta JSON Processing 2.0.

=== Jakarta JSON Binding

Jakarta JSON Binding provides a binding layer for converting Java
objects to and from JSON messages. Jakarta JSON Binding also supports
the ability to customize the default mapping process used in this
binding layer through the use of Java annotations for a given field,
JavaBean property, type or package, or by providing an implementation
of a property naming strategy.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta JSON Binding 2.0.

=== Jakarta Concurrency

Jakarta Concurrency is a standard API for providing asynchronous
capabilities to Jakarta EE application components through the following
types of objects: managed executor service, managed scheduled executor
service, managed thread factory, and context service.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Concurrency 2.0.

=== Jakarta Batch

Batch jobs are tasks that can be executed without user interaction. The
Batch Applications for the Java Platform specification is a batch
framework that provides support for creating and running batch jobs in
Java applications. The batch framework consists of a batch runtime, a
job specification language based on XML, a Java API to interact with
the batch runtime, and a Java API to implement batch artifacts.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Batch 2.0.

=== Jakarta Activation

The Jakarta Activation is used by the Jakarta Mail. Jakarta Activation
provides standard services to determine the type of an arbitrary piece
of data, encapsulate access to it, discover the operations available on
it, and create the appropriate JavaBeans component to perform those
operations.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Activation 2.0.

=== Jakarta XML Binding

The Jakarta XML Binding provides a convenient way to bind an XML schema
to a representation in Java language programs. JAXB can be used
independently or in combination with Jakarta XML Web Services, in which
case it provides a standard data binding for web service messages. All
Jakarta EE application client containers, web containers, and Jakarta
Enterprise Beans containers support the XML Binding API.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta XML Binding 3.0.

=== Jakarta XML Web Services

The Jakarta XML Web Services specification provides support for web
services that use the Jakarta XML Binding API for binding XML data to
Java objects. The Jakarta XML Web Services specification defines client
APIs for accessing web services as well as techniques for implementing
web service endpoints. The Implementing Enterprise Web Services
specification describes the deployment of Jakarta XML Web Services
based services and clients. The Jakarta Enterprise Beans and Jakarta
Servlet specifications also describe aspects of such deployment.
Jakarta XML Web Services based applications can be deployed using any
of these deployment models.

The Jakarta XML Web Services specification describes the support for
message handlers that can process message requests and responses. In
general, these message handlers execute in the same container and with
the same privileges and execution context as the Jakarta XML Web
Services client or endpoint component with which they are associated.
These message handlers have access to the same JNDI namespace as their
associated component. Custom serializers and deserializers, if
supported, are treated in the same way as message handlers.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta XML Web Services 3.0.

=== Jakarta SOAP with Attachments

The Jakarta SOAP with Attachments is a low-level API on which Jakarta
XML Web Services depends. Jakarta SOAP with Attachments enables the
production and consumption of messages that conform to the SOAP 1.1 and
1.2 specifications and the Jakarta SOAP with Attachments note. Most
developers do not use the Jakarta SOAP with Attachments, instead using
the higher-level Jakarta XML Web Services API.

=== Jakarta Annotations

Annotations enable a declarative style of programming in the Java
platform.

The Jakarta EE 9 platform requires Jakarta Annotations 2.0.
