The following sections give a brief summary of the technologies required
by the Jakarta EE platform and the APIs used in Jakarta EE applications.

[[BNACL]][[enterprise-javabeans-technology]]

=== Jakarta Enterprise Beans Technology

An enterprise bean component, or enterprise bean, is a body
of code that has fields and methods to implement modules of business
logic. You can think of an enterprise bean as a building block that can
be used alone or with other enterprise beans to execute business logic
on the Jakarta EE server.

Enterprise beans are either session beans or message-driven beans.

* A session bean represents a transient conversation with a client. When
the client finishes executing, the session bean and its data are gone.
* A message-driven bean combines features of a session bean and a
message listener, allowing a business component to receive messages
asynchronously. Commonly, these are Jakarta Messaging messages.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Enterprise Beans 3.2 and
Jakarta Interceptors 1.2.

[[BNACM]][[jakarta-servlet-technology]]

=== Jakarta Servlet Technology

Jakarta Servlet technology lets you define HTTP-specific servlet classes. A
servlet class extends the capabilities of servers that host applications
accessed by way of a request-response programming model. Although
servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to
extend the applications hosted by web servers.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new Jakarta Servlet technology features include
the following:

* Server Push
* HTTP Trailer

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Servlet 4.0.

[[BNACP]][[jakarta-faces-technology]]

=== Jakarta Faces Technology

Jakarta Faces technology is a user interface framework for building
web applications. The main components of Jakarta Faces technology are
as follows:

* A GUI component framework.
* A flexible model for rendering components in different kinds of HTML
or different markup languages and technologies. A `Renderer` object
generates the markup to render the component and converts the data
stored in a model object to types that can be represented in a view.
* A standard `RenderKit` for generating HTML 4.01 markup.

The following features support the GUI components:

* Input validation
* Event handling
* Data conversion between model objects and components
* Managed model object creation
* Page navigation configuration
* Jakarta Expression Language

All this functionality is available using standard Java APIs and
XML-based configuration files.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new features of Jakarta Faces technology
include the following:

* Direct support for WebSockets via the new `<f:websocket>` tag
* Class-level bean validation via the new `<f:validateWholeBean>` tag
* A Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection compatible `@ManagedProperty` annotation
* Enhanced component search expression framework

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Faces 2.3 and Jakarta Expression
Language 3.0.

For an excellent summary of what's new in Jakarta Faces 2.3,
see `https://javaserverfaces.github.io/users.html`.

[[BNACN]][[jakarta-server-pages-technology]]

=== Jakarta Server Pages Technology

Jakarta Server Pages technology lets you put snippets of servlet code
directly into a text-based document. A Jakarta Server Pages page is a text-based document
that contains two types of text:

* Static data, which can be expressed in any text-based format, such as
HTML or XML
* JSP elements, which determine how the page constructs dynamic content

The Jakarta Server Pages technology is derived from and compatible with the JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology.
For information about JSP technology, see _The Java EE 5 Tutorial_ at
`http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/`.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Server Pages 2.3 for compatibility
with earlier releases but recommends the use of Facelets as the display
technology in new applications.

[[BNACO]][[jakarta-standard-tag-library]]

=== Jakarta Standard Tag Library

The Jakarta Standard Tag Library encapsulates core
functionality common to many Jakarta Server Pages applications. Instead of mixing tags
from numerous vendors in your Jakarta Server Pages applications, you use a single,
standard set of tags. This standardization allows you to deploy your
applications on any Jakarta Server Pages container that supports Jakarta Standard Tag Library and makes it more
likely that the implementation of the tags is optimized.

Jakarta Standard Tag Library has iterator and conditional tags for handling flow control, tags
for manipulating XML documents, internationalization tags, tags for
accessing databases using SQL, and tags for commonly used functions.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Standard Tag Library 1.2.

[[BNADB]][[jakarta-persistence]]

=== Jakarta Persistence

Jakarta Persistence is a Java standards–based solution for
persistence. Persistence uses an object/relational mapping approach to
bridge the gap between an object-oriented model and a relational
database. The Jakarta Persistence can also be used in Java SE
applications outside of the Jakarta EE environment. Jakarta Persistence
consists of the following areas:

* The Jakarta Persistence
* The query language
* Object/relational mapping metadata

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Persistence 2.2.

[[BNACR]][[jakarta-transactions]]

=== Jakarta Transactions

Jakarta Transactions provides a standard interface for
demarcating transactions. The Jakarta EE architecture provides a default
auto commit to handle transaction commits and rollbacks. An auto commit
means that any other applications that are viewing data will see the
updated data after each database read or write operation. However, if
your application performs two separate database access operations that
depend on each other, you will want to use the Jakarta Transactions to demarcate
where the entire transaction, including both operations, begins, rolls
back, and commits.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Transactions 1.2.

[[GIRBT]][[jakarta-restful-web-services]]

=== Jakarta RESTful Web Services

Jakarta RESTful Web Services defines APIs for the
development of web services built according to the Representational
State Transfer (REST) architectural style. A Jakarta RESTful application is a web
application that consists of classes packaged as a servlet in a WAR file
along with required libraries.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new RESTful web services features include the following:

* Reactive Client API
+
When the results of an invocation on a target resource are received, enhancements to the completion stage APIs in Java SE allow the sequence of those results to be specified, prioritized, combined, or concatenated, and how exceptions can be handled.
* Enhancements in support for server-sent events
+
Clients may subscribe to server-issued event notifications using a long-running connection. Support for a new media type, text/event-stream, has been added.
* Support for Jakarta JSON Binding objects, and improved integration with Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection,
Jakarta Servlet, and Jakarta Bean Validation technologies

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta RESTful Web Services 2.1.

[[GJXSD]][[jakarta-managed-beans]]

=== Jakarta Managed Beans

Jakarta Managed Beans, lightweight container-managed objects (POJOs) with
minimal requirements, support a small set of basic services, such as
resource injection, lifecycle callbacks, and interceptors. Managed Beans
represent a generalization of the managed beans specified by Jakarta Faces
technology and can be used anywhere in a Jakarta EE application, not
just in web modules.

The Jakarta Managed Beans specification is part of the Jakarta EE 8 platform
specification. The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Managed Beans
1.0.

[[GJXVO]][[jakarta-context-and-dependency-injection]]

=== Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection

Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) defines a set of
contextual services, provided by Jakarta EE containers, that make it easy
for developers to use enterprise beans along with Jakarta Faces
technology in web applications. Designed for use with stateful objects,
CDI also has many broader uses, allowing developers a great deal of
flexibility to integrate different kinds of components in a loosely
coupled but typesafe way.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new CDI features include the following:

* An API for bootstrapping a CDI container in Java SE 8
* Support for observer ordering, which determines the order in which the observer methods for a particular event are invoked, and support for firing events asynchronously
* Configurators interfaces, which are used for dynamically defining and modifying CDI objects
* Built-in annotation literals, a convenience feature for creating instances of annotations, and more

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 2.0.

[[GJXVG]][[jakarta-dependency-injection]]

=== Jakarta Dependency Injection

Jakarta Dependency Injection defines a standard set of annotations (and
one interface) for use on injectable classes.

In the Jakarta EE platform, CDI provides support for Dependency Injection.
Specifically, you can use injection points only in a CDI-enabled
application.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Dependency Injection 1.0.

[[GJXTY]][[jakarta-bean-validation]]

=== Jakarta Bean Validation

The Jakarta Bean Validation specification defines a metadata model and API for
validating data in JavaBeans components. Instead of distributing
validation of data over several layers, such as the browser and the
server side, you can define the validation constraints in one place and
share them across the different layers.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new Jakarta Bean Validation features include the following:

* Support for new features in Java SE 8, such as the Date-Time API
* Addition of new built-in Jakarta Bean Validation constraints


The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Bean Validation 2.0.

[[BNACQ]][[jakarta-messaging]]

=== Jakarta Messaging

Jakarta Messaging is a messaging standard that allows
Jakarta EE application components to create, send, receive, and read
messages. It enables distributed communication that is loosely coupled,
reliable, and asynchronous.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Messaging 2.0.

[[BNACZ]][[jakarta-connectors]]

=== Jakarta Connectors

The Jakarta Connectors is used by tools vendors and system
integrators to create resource adapters that support access to
enterprise information systems that can be plugged in to any Jakarta EE
product. A resource adapter is a software component that allows Jakarta EE
application components to access and interact with the underlying
resource manager of the EIS. Because a resource adapter is specific to
its resource manager, a different resource adapter typically exists for
each type of database or enterprise information system.

The Jakarta Connectors also provides a performance-oriented,
secure, scalable, and message-based transactional integration of Jakarta EE
platform-based web services with existing EISs that can be either
synchronous or asynchronous. Existing applications and EISs integrated
through the Jakarta Connectors into the Jakarta EE platform can
be exposed as XML-based web services by using Jakarta XML Web Services and Jakarta EE
component models. Thus Jakarta XML Web Services and the Jakarta Connectors are
complementary technologies for enterprise application integration (EAI)
and end-to-end business integration.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Connectors 1.7.

[[BNACS]][[jakarta-mail]]

=== Jakarta Mail

Jakarta EE applications use the Jakarta Mail to send email notifications.
The Jakarta Mail has two parts:

* An application-level interface used by the application components to
send mail
* A service provider interface

The Jakarta EE platform includes the Jakarta Mail with a service provider
that allows application components to send Internet mail.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Mail 1.6.

[[GIRBE]][[jakarta-authorization]]

=== Jakarta Authorization

The Jakarta Authorization specification
defines a contract between a Jakarta EE application server and an
authorization policy provider. All Jakarta EE containers support this
contract.

The Jakarta Authorization specification defines `java.security.Permission` classes that
satisfy the Jakarta EE authorization model. The specification defines the
binding of container-access decisions to operations on instances of
these permission classes. It defines the semantics of policy providers
that use the new permission classes to address the authorization
requirements of the Jakarta EE platform, including the definition and use
of roles.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Authorization 1.5.

[[GIRGP]][[jakarta-authentication]]

=== Jakarta Authentication

The Jakarta Authentication
specification defines a service provider interface (SPI) by
which authentication providers that implement message authentication
mechanisms may be integrated in client or server message-processing
containers or runtimes. Authentication providers integrated through this
interface operate on network messages provided to them by their calling
containers. The authentication providers transform outgoing messages so
that the source of each message can be authenticated by the receiving
container, and the recipient of the message can be authenticated by the
message sender. Authentication providers authenticate each incoming
message and return to their calling containers the identity established
as a result of the message authentication.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Authentication 1.1.

[[jakarta-security]]
=== Jakarta Security
Jakarta Security specification defines portable, plug-in interfaces for
HTTP authentication and identity stores, and an injectable SecurityContext interface
that provides an API for programmatic security.

Implementations of the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` interface can be used to
authenticate callers of web applications. An application can supply its own
`HttpAuthenticationMechanism`, or use one of the default implementations provided
by the container.

Implementations of the `IdentityStore` interface can be used to validate user
credentials and retrieve group information. An application can provide its own
`IdentityStore`, or use the built in LDAP or Database store.

The `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` and `IdentityStore` APIs provide an advantage over
container-provided implementations in that they allow an application to control
the authentication process, and the identity stores used for authentication,
in a standard, portable way.

The `SecurityContext` API is intended for use by application code to query and
interact with the current security context. The specification also provides
for default group-to-role mapping, and defines a principal type called
`CallerPrincipal` that can represent the identity of an application caller.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Security 1.0.

[[CJAHDJBJ]][[jakarta-websocket]]

=== Jakarta WebSocket

WebSocket is an application protocol that provides full-duplex
communications between two peers over TCP. Jakarta WebSocket
enables Jakarta EE applications to create endpoints using annotations that
specify the configuration parameters of the endpoint and designate its
lifecycle callback methods.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta WebSocket 1.1.

[[CJAGIEEI]][[jakarta-json-processing]]

=== Jakarta JSON Processing

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text-based data exchange format derived from JavaScript that
is used in web services and other connected applications. Jakarta
JSON Processing enables Jakarta EE applications to parse,
transform, and query JSON data using the object model or the streaming
model.

In the Jakarta EE 8 platform, new features of Jakarta JSON Processing include support for the following:

* JSON Pointer
+
Defines a string syntax for referencing a specific value within a JSON document. JSON Pointer includes APIs for extracting values from a target document and transforming them to create a new JSON document.
* JSON Patch
+
Defines a format for expressing a sequence of operations to be applied to a JSON document.
* JSON Merge Patch
+
Defines a format and processing rules for applying operations to a JSON document that are based upon specific content of the target document.
* The addition of editing and transformation functions to basic JSON document processing.
* Helper classes and methods, called JSON Collectors, which leverage features of the Stream API that was introduced in Java SE 8.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta JSON Processing 1.1.

[[jakarta-json-binding]]
=== Jakarta JSON Binding

Jakarta JSON Binding provides a binding layer for converting Java objects to and from JSON messages. Jakarta JSON Binding also supports the ability to customize the default mapping process used in this binding layer through the use of Java annotations for a given field, JavaBean property, type or package, or by providing an implementation of a property naming strategy.

Jakarta JSON Binding is new to the Jakarta EE 8 platform. The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta JSON Binding 1.0.

[[CJAFGFCJ]][[jakarta-concurrency]]

=== Jakarta Concurrency

Jakarta Concurrency is a standard API for providing
asynchronous capabilities to Jakarta EE application components through the
following types of objects: managed executor service, managed scheduled
executor service, managed thread factory, and context service.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Concurrency 1.0.

[[CJAJHGIH]][[jakarta-batch]]

=== Jakarta Batch

Batch jobs are tasks that can be executed without user interaction. The
Batch Applications for the Java Platform specification is a batch
framework that provides support for creating and running batch jobs in
Java applications. The batch framework consists of a batch runtime, a
job specification language based on XML, a Java API to interact with the
batch runtime, and a Java API to implement batch artifacts.

The Jakarta EE 8 platform requires Jakarta Batch 1.0.
