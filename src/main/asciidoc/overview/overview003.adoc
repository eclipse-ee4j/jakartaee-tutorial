== Jakarta EE Application Model

The Jakarta EE application model begins with the Java programming language and the Java virtual machine.
The proven portability, security, and developer productivity they provide form the basis of the application model.
Jakarta EE is designed to support applications that implement enterprise services for customers, employees, suppliers, partners, and others who make demands on or contributions to the enterprise.
Such applications are inherently complex, potentially accessing data from a variety of sources and distributing applications to a variety of clients.

To better control and manage these applications, the business functions to support these various users are conducted in the middle tier.
The middle tier represents an environment that is closely controlled by an enterprise's information technology department.
The middle tier is typically run on dedicated server hardware and has access to the full services of the enterprise.

The Jakarta EE application model defines an architecture for implementing services as multitier applications that deliver the scalability, accessibility, and manageability needed by enterprise-level applications.
This model partitions the work needed to implement a multitier service into the following parts:

* The business and presentation logic to be implemented by the developer

* The standard system services provided by the Jakarta EE platform

The developer can rely on the platform to provide solutions for the hard systems-level problems of developing a multitier service.
