== Jakarta EE Containers

Normally, thin-client multitiered applications are hard to write because they involve many lines of intricate code to handle transaction and state management, multithreading, resource pooling, and other complex low-level details.
The component-based and platform-independent Jakarta EE architecture makes applications easy to write because business logic is organized into reusable components.
In addition, the Jakarta EE server provides underlying services in the form of a container for every component type.
Because you do not have to develop these services yourself, you are free to concentrate on solving the business problem at hand.

=== Container Services

Containers are the interface between a component and the low-level, platform-specific functionality that supports the component.
Before it can be executed, a web, enterprise bean, or application client component must be assembled into a Jakarta EE module and deployed into its container.

The assembly process involves specifying container settings for each component in the Jakarta EE application and for the Jakarta EE application itself.
Container settings customize the underlying support provided by the Jakarta EE server, including such services as security, transaction management, Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API lookups, and remote connectivity.
Here are some of the highlights.

* The Jakarta EE security model lets you configure a web component or enterprise bean so that system resources are accessed only by authorized users.

* The Jakarta EE transaction model lets you specify relationships among methods that make up a single transaction so that all methods in one transaction are treated as a single unit.

* JNDI lookup services provide a unified interface to multiple naming and directory services in the enterprise so that application components can access these services.

* The Jakarta EE remote connectivity model manages low-level communications between clients and enterprise beans.
After an enterprise bean is created, a client invokes methods on it as if it were in the same virtual machine.

Because the Jakarta EE architecture provides configurable services, components within the same application can behave differently based on where they are deployed.
For example, an enterprise bean can have security settings that allow it a certain level of access to database data in one production environment and another level of database access in another production environment.

The container also manages nonconfigurable services, such as enterprise bean and servlet lifecycles, database connection resource pooling, data persistence, and access to the Jakarta EE platform APIs (see <<jakarta-ee-apis>>.

=== Container Types

The deployment process installs Jakarta EE application components in the Jakarta EE containers, as illustrated in <<jakarta-ee-server-and-containers>>.

The server and containers are as follows:

* Jakarta EE server: The runtime portion of a Jakarta EE product.
A Jakarta EE server provides enterprise and web containers.

* Jakarta Enterprise Bean container: Manages the execution of enterprise beans for Jakarta EE applications.
Jakarta Enterprise Beans and their container run on the Jakarta EE server.

* Web container: Manages the execution of web pages, servlets, and some enterprise bean components for Jakarta EE applications.
Web components and their container run on the Jakarta EE server.

* Application client container: Manages the execution of application client components.
Application clients and their container run on the client.

* Applet container: Manages the execution of applets.
Consists of a web browser and a Java Plug-in running on the client together.
