== Eclipse GlassFish Server Tools

Eclipse GlassFish Server is a compliant implementation of the Jakarta EE platform.
In addition to supporting all the APIs described in the previous sections, Eclipse GlassFish Server includes a number of Jakarta EE tools that are not part of the Jakarta EE platform but are provided as a convenience to the developer.

This section briefly summarizes the tools that make up Eclipse GlassFish Server.
Instructions for starting and stopping Eclipse GlassFish Server, starting the Administration Console, and starting and stopping Apache Derby are in xref:using-the-tutorial-examples[xrefstyle=full].

Eclipse GlassFish Server contains the tools listed in <<glassfish-server-tools>>.
Basic usage information for many of the tools appears throughout the tutorial.
For detailed information, see the online help in the GUI tools.
