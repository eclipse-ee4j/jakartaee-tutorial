== Jakarta EE 9 Platform Highlights

The goal of the Jakarta EE 9 release is to deliver a set of specifications functionally similar to Jakarta EE 8 but in the new Jakarta EE 9 namespace jakarta.*.

In addition, the Jakarta EE 9 release removes a small set of specifications from Jakarta EE 8 that were old, optional, or deprecated in order to reduce the surface area of the APIs to ensure that it is easier for new vendors to enter the ecosystem â€“ as well as reduce the burden on implementation, migration, and maintenance of these old APIs.

The following Jakarta EE Technologies were removed from the Jakarta EE Platform:

* XML Registries 1.0

* XML RPC 1.1

* Deployment 1.7

* Management 1.1

* Distributed Interoperability (EJB 3.2 Core Specification, Chapter 10)

Aside from the removed technologies, some technologies in Jakarta EE 9 release are marked as optional.
The reason for this is that some of the technologies originally included in Jakarta EE are no longer as relevant as they were when they were introduced to the platform.

Platform Specification Project can decide to officially "remove" the "optional" feature from the Platform in the next (or beyond) releases.

The following technologies are optional:

* Jakarta Enterprise Beans 3.2 and earlier entity beans and associated Jakarta Enterprise Beans QL

* Jakarta Enterprise Beans 2.x API group

* Jakarta Enterprise Web Services 2.0

* Jakarta SOAP with Attachments 2.0

* Jakarta Web Services Metadata 3.0

* Jakarta XML Web Services 3.0

* Jakarta XML Binding 3.0
