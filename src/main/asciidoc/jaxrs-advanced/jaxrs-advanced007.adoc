== Using Jakarta REST with Jakarta XML Binding

Jakarta XML Binding is an XML-to-Java binding technology that simplifies the development of web services by enabling transformations between schema and Java objects and between XML instance documents and Java object instances.
An XML schema defines the data elements and structure of an XML document.
You can use Jakarta XML Binding APIs and tools to establish mappings between Java classes and XML schema.
Jakarta XML Binding technology provides the tools that enable you to convert your XML documents to and from Java objects.

By using Jakarta XML Binding, you can manipulate data objects in the following ways.

* You can start with an XML schema definition (XSD) and use `xjc`, the Jakarta XML Binding schema compiler tool, to create a set of Jakarta XML Binding annotated Java classes that map to the elements and types defined in the XSD schema.

* You can start with a set of Java classes and use `schemagen`, the Jakarta XML Binding schema generator tool, to generate an XML schema.

* Once a mapping between the XML schema and the Java classes exists, you can use the Jakarta XML Binding runtime to marshal and unmarshal your XML documents to and from Java objects and use the resulting Java classes to assemble a web services application.

XML is a common media format that RESTful services consume and produce.
To deserialize and serialize XML, you can represent requests and responses by Jakarta XML Binding annotated objects.
Your Jakarta REST application can use the Jakarta XML Binding objects to manipulate XML data.
Jakarta XML Binding objects can be used as request entity parameters and response entities.
The Jakarta REST runtime environment includes standard `MessageBodyReader` and `MessageBodyWriter` provider interfaces for reading and writing Jakarta XML Binding objects as entities.

With Jakarta REST, you enable access to your services by publishing resources.
Resources are just simple Java classes with some additional Jakarta REST annotations.
These annotations express the following:

* The path of the resource (the URL you use to access it)

* The HTTP method you use to call a certain method (for example, the `GET` or `POST` method)

* The MIME type with which a method accepts or responds

As you define the resources for your application, consider the type of data you want to expose.
You may already have a relational database that contains information you want to expose to users, or you may have static content that does not reside in a database but does need to be distributed as resources.
Using Jakarta REST, you can distribute content from multiple sources.
RESTful web services can use various types of input/output formats for request and response.
The `customer` example, described in <<the-customer-example-application>>, uses XML.

Resources have representations.
A resource representation is the content in the HTTP message that is sent to, or returned from, the resource using the URI.
Each representation a resource supports has a corresponding media type.
For example, if a resource is going to return content formatted as XML, you can use `application/xml` as the associated media type in the HTTP message.Depending on the requirements of your application, resources can return representations in a preferred single format or in multiple formats.
Jakarta REST provides `@Consumes` and `@Produces` annotations to declare the media types that are acceptable for a resource method to read and write.

Jakarta REST also maps Java types to and from resource representations using entity providers.
A `MessageBodyReader` entity provider reads a request entity and deserializes the request entity into a Java type.
A `MessageBodyWriter` entity provider serializes from a Java type into a response entity.
For example, if a `String` value is used as the request entity parameter, the `MessageBodyReader` entity provider deserializes the request body into a new `String`.
If a Jakarta XML Binding type is used as the return type on a resource method, the `MessageBodyWriter` serializes the Jakarta XML Binding object into a response body.

By default, the Jakarta REST runtime environment attempts to create and use a default `JAXBContext` class for Jakarta XML Binding classes.
However, if the default `JAXBContext` class is not suitable, then you can supply a `JAXBContext` class for the application using a Jakarta REST `ContextResolver` provider interface.

The following sections explain how to use Jakarta XML Binding with Jakarta REST resource methods.

=== Using Java Objects to Model Your Data

If you do not have an XML schema definition for the data you want to expose, you can model your data as Java classes, add Jakarta XML Binding annotations to these classes, and use Jakarta XML Binding to generate an XML schema for your data.
For example, if the data you want to expose is a collection of products and each product has an ID, a name, a description, and a price, you can model it as a Java class as follows:

[source,java]
----
@XmlRootElement(name="product")
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class Product {

    @XmlElement(required=true)
    protected int id;
    @XmlElement(required=true)
    protected String name;
    @XmlElement(required=true)
    protected String description;
    @XmlElement(required=true)
    protected int price;

    public Product() {}

    // Getter and setter methods
    // ...
}
----

Run the Jakarta XML Binding schema generator on the command line to generate the corresponding XML schema definition:

[source,shell]
----
schemagen Product.java
----

This command produces the XML schema as an `.xsd` file:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<xs:schema version="1.0" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

    <xs:element name="product" type="product"/>

    <xs:complexType name="product">
      <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element name="id" type="xs:int"/>
        <xs:element name="name" type="xs:string"/>
        <xs:element name="description" type="xs:string"/>
        <xs:element name="price" type="xs:int"/>
      </xs:sequence>
    <xs:complexType>
</xs:schema>
----

Once you have this mapping, you can create `Product` objects in your application, return them, and use them as parameters in Jakarta REST resource methods.
The Jakarta REST runtime uses Jakarta XML Binding to convert the XML data from the request into a `Product` object and to convert a `Product` object into XML data for the response.
The following resource class provides a simple example:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/product")
public class ProductService {
    @GET
    @Path("/get")
    @Produces("application/xml")
    public Product getProduct() {
        Product prod = new Product();
        prod.setId(1);
        prod.setName("Mattress");
        prod.setDescription("Queen size mattress");
        prod.setPrice(500);
        return prod;
    }

    @POST
    @Path("/create")
    @Consumes("application/xml")
    public Response createProduct(Product prod) {
        // Process or store the product and return a response
        // ...
    }
}
----

Some IDEs, such as NetBeans IDE, will run the schema generator tool automatically during the build process if you add Java classes that have Jakarta XML Binding annotations to your project.
For a detailed example, see <<the-customer-example-application>>.
The `customer` example contains a more complex relationship between the Java classes that model the data, which results in a more hierarchical XML representation.

=== Starting from an Existing XML Schema Definition

If you already have an XML schema definition in an `.xsd` file for the data you want to expose, use the Jakarta XML Binding schema compiler tool.
Consider this simple example of an `.xsd` file:

[source,xml]
----
<xs:schema targetNamespace="http://xml.product"
           xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
           elementFormDefault="qualified"
           xmlns:myco="http://xml.product">
  <xs:element name="product" type="myco:Product"/>
  <xs:complexType name="Product">
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element name="id" type="xs:int"/>
      <xs:element name="name" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="description" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="price" type="xs:int"/>
    </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>
</xs:schema>
----

Run the schema compiler tool on the command line as follows:

[source,shell]
----
xjc Product.xsd
----

This command generates the source code for Java classes that correspond to the types defined in the `.xsd` file.
The schema compiler tool generates a Java class for each `complexType` defined in the `.xsd` file.
The fields of each generated Java class are the same as the elements inside the corresponding `complexType`, and the class contains getter and setter methods for these fields.

In this case, the schema compiler tool generates the classes `product.xml.Product` and `product.xml.ObjectFactory`.
The `Product` class contains Jakarta XML Binding annotations, and its fields correspond to those in the `.xsd` definition:

[source,java]
----
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
@XmlType(name = "Product", propOrder = {
    "id",
    "name",
    "description",
    "price"
})
public class Product {
    protected int id;
    @XmlElement(required = true)
    protected String name;
    @XmlElement(required = true)
    protected String description;
    protected int price;

    // Setter and getter methods
    // ...
}
----

You can create instances of the `Product` class from your application (for example, from a database).
The generated class `product.xml.ObjectFactory` contains a method that allows you to convert these objects to Jakarta XML Binding elements that can be returned as XML inside Jakarta REST resource methods:

[source,java]
----
@XmlElementDecl(namespace = "http://xml.product", name = "product")
public JAXBElement<Product> createProduct(Product value) {
    return new JAXBElement<Product>(_Product_QNAME, Product.class, null, value);
}
----

The following code shows how to use the generated classes to return a Jakarta XML Binding element as XML in a Jakarta REST resource method:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/product")
public class ProductService {
    @GET
    @Path("/get")
    @Produces("application/xml")
    public JAXBElement<Product> getProduct() {
        Product prod = new Product();
        prod.setId(1);
        prod.setName("Mattress");
        prod.setDescription("Queen size mattress");
        prod.setPrice(500);
        return new ObjectFactory().createProduct(prod);
    }
}
----

For `@POST` and `@PUT` resource methods, you can use a `Product` object directly as a parameter.
Jakarta REST maps the XML data from the request into a `Product` object.

[source,java]
----
@Path("/product")
public class ProductService {
    @GET
    // ...

    @POST
    @Path("/create")
    @Consumes("application/xml")
    public Response createProduct(Product prod) {
        // Process or store the product and return a response
        // ...
    }
}
----

=== Using JSON with Jakarta REST and Jakarta XML Binding

Jakarta REST can automatically read and write XML using Jakarta XML Binding, but it can also work with JSON data.
JSON is a simple text-based format for data exchange derived from JavaScript.
For the preceding examples, the XML representation of a product is

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<product>
  <id>1</id>
  <name>Mattress</name>
  <description>Queen size mattress</description>
  <price>500</price>
</product>
----


The equivalent JSON representation is
[source,json]
----
{
    "id":"1",
    "name":"Mattress",
    "description":"Queen size mattress",
    "price":500
}
----

You can add the format `application/json` or `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON` to the `@Produces` annotation in resource methods to produce responses with JSON data:

[source,java]
----
@GET
@Path("/get")
@Produces({"application/xml","application/json"})
public Product getProduct() { ... }
----

In this example, the default response is XML, but the response is a JSON object if the client makes a `GET` request that includes this header:

[source,http]
----
Accept: application/json
----

The resource methods can also accept JSON data for Jakarta XML Binding annotated classes:

[source,java]
----
@POST
@Path("/create")
@Consumes({"application/xml","application/json"})
public Response createProduct(Product prod) { ... }
----

The client should include the following header when submitting JSON data with a `POST` request:

[source,http]
----
Content-Type: application/json
----
