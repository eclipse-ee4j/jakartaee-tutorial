== Integrating Jakarta REST with Jakarta Enterprise Beans Technology and CDI

Jakarta REST works with Jakarta Enterprise Beans technology and Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI).

In general, for Jakarta REST to work with enterprise beans, you need to annotate the class of a bean with `@Path` to convert it to a root resource class.
You can use the `@Path` annotation with stateless session beans and singleton POJO beans.

The following code snippet shows a stateless session bean and a singleton bean that have been converted to Jakarta REST root resource classes.

[source,java]
----
@Stateless
@Path("stateless-bean")
public class StatelessResource {...}

@Singleton
@Path("singleton-bean")
public class SingletonResource {...}
----

Session beans can also be used for subresources.

Jakarta REST and CDI have slightly different component models.
By default, Jakarta REST root resource classes are managed in the request scope, and no annotations are required for specifying the scope.
CDI managed beans annotated with `@RequestScoped` or `@ApplicationScoped` can be converted to Jakarta REST resource classes.

The following code snippet shows a Jakarta REST resource class.

[source,java]
----
@Path("/employee/{id}")
public class Employee {
    public Employee(@PathParam("id") String id) {...}
}

@Path("{lastname}")
public final class EmpDetails {...}
----

The following code snippet shows this Jakarta REST resource class converted to a CDI bean.
The beans must be proxyable, so the `Employee` class requires a nonprivate constructor with no parameters, and the `EmpDetails` class must not be `final`.

[source,java]
----
@Path("/employee/{id}")
@RequestScoped
public class Employee {
    public Employee() {...}

    @Inject
    public Employee(@PathParam("id") String id) {...}
}

@Path("{lastname}")
@RequestScoped
public class EmpDetails {...}
