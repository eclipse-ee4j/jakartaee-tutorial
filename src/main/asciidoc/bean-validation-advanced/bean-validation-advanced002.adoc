== Customizing Validator Messages

Jakarta Bean Validation includes a resource bundle of default messages for the built-in constraints.
These messages can be customized and can be localized for non-English-speaking locales.

=== The ValidationMessages Resource Bundle

The `ValidationMessages` resource bundle and the locale variants of this resource bundle contain strings that override the default validation messages.
The `ValidationMessages` resource bundle is typically a properties file, `ValidationMessages.properties`, in the default package of an application.

==== Localizing Validation Messages

Locale variants of `ValidationMessages.properties` are added by appending an underscore and the locale prefix to the base name of the file.
For example, the Spanish locale variant resource bundle would be `ValidationMessages_es.properties`.
