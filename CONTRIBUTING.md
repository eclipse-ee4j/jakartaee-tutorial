# Contributing to Jakarta EE Documentation

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The Eclipse Documentation for Jakarta EE project hosts documentation intended for programmers interested in developing and deploying Jakarta EE applications. It covers the technologies comprising the Jakarta EE platform and describes how to develop applications using Jakarta EE components and deploy them on Jakarta EE runtimes.

Eclipse project page: https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jakartaee-documentation

## Developer resources

The project maintains the following source code repositories

* [eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-examples](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-examples) - Contains examples used in the tutorial (and additional examples)
* [jakartaee/jakartaee-documentation](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-documentation) - builds documentation site
* [jakartaee/jakartaee-documentation-ui](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartaee-documentation-ui) - HTML and CSS assets used for the documentation site look and feel.
* 
### Coding guidelines

#### Branches

##### Normal Branches

* Restrict work on a single feature or issue to a single branch
* Branch name: `feature/[issue #]_description_if_necessary`
  * Example: `feature/123_this_is_an_example`
  * Example: `feature/123`
  * Example: `feature/remove_stale_files (no issue number)`

##### Release Branches

* For the main tutorial repo and any other repos with Antora content (that does not include a playbook), we’ll keep a release branch so that we maintain docs for the particular version of Jakarta EE.
* The main branch will represent the current release. All previous releases should have their own branch.
Branch name: `release/[version]`
  * Example: `release/9.1`
  * Example: `release/10`

##### Commits

* Include the issue # in the message (if applicable)
  * Example: “#123 Adds a the ability to synchronize with the example repo”
  * Example: “Updates #123 with changes for pom file”
  * Example: “Removed stale files”

### Creating diagrams

Diagrams are located in `src/main/antora/modules/common/images` or in the `images` folder of the module;
for example `src/main/antora/modules/cdi/images`.
Use [draw.io](https://draw.io) to create/adjust diagrams.
This tool is primarily chosen for being free to use and the most flexible.
For portability and maintainability, make sure that the diagram is saved/exported into following three formats:

- `*.drawio` (use the Save function)
- `*.vsdx` (use the Export function)
- Editable `*.svg` (use the Save As function) 

The `*.drawio` format ensures being able to reopen exactly the intended diagram in the original tool.
The `*.vsdx` format ensures being able to import the diagram in another tool as this is the most supported format by
various diagramming tools, just in case that draw.io stops to exist in some unpredictable future.
The `*.svg` format is ultimately used to embed the diagram in the tutorial document.

Also, make sure you use a hyphen ("-") in the name as a delimiter; for example `persistance-mapping`.

#### Diagram requirements

- Font must be 'Open Sans' conform
  the [Jakarta EE Brand Usage Handbook](https://jakarta.ee/legal/trademark_guidelines/jakarta-ee-branding-guidelines.pdf).
  You can use Google Fonts for this.
  In case you're using draw.io:
    - Wherever you see a 'Font' dropdown, unfold it.
      ![Select font](readme-images/drawio-font-1-select-font.png)
    - If there's no 'Open Sans' option, pick 'Custom'.
      ![Select custom](readme-images/drawio-font-2-select-custom.png)
    - Choose the 'Google Fonts' option and set the font name to 'Open Sans' and apply.
      ![Set Google Open Sans](readme-images/drawio-font-3-set-google-open-sans.png)
    - Type text and verify that the font is Open Sans
      ![Using Google Open Sans](readme-images/drawio-font-4-using-google-open-sans.png)
- Font size for all text should be 12pt 

- Color must be one of those defined
  in [Jakarta EE Brand Usage Handbook](https://jakarta.ee/legal/trademark_guidelines/jakarta-ee-branding-guidelines.pdf),
  along with black and white (you can use opacity to affect the depth of the color).
